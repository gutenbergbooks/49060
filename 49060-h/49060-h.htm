<p class="center bigger">THE WALCOTT TWINS</p>




<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>GAY AND MAY</small></h2>


<p>The Mistress of the house lay among her pillows,
her brows drawn into the nearest semblance of a
frown that her gentle countenance could assume.
Nurse—bearing a tiny, moving bundle of muslin
and flannel—and the father were at the bedside.</p>

<p>The father's forehead wore an unmistakable
frown. It was evident that something displeased
him, but who would have dreamed that it was the
gurgling mite in the flannel blanket? Yet he
pointed in that direction as he said,—</p>

<p>"Take him away. He has made trouble
enough."</p>

<p>"H'indeed, Mr. Walcott," cried nurse, "'E's
the best baby h'I' ave ever seen h'in this 'ouse!
'E's never cried before."</p>

<p>"Take him away!" repeated the father, still
frowning. "He may be the best baby in the
world—a future President of the United States,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>even,—but he can't stay in this room another
minute. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," nurse replied somewhat tartly.</p>

<p>Nurse thought the father a great bear. Of
course she could not tell him so, but she could and
she did show him that an imported English nurse
chooses her own rate of speed. She moved slowly
toward the door, holding her head with its imposing
white cap well up in the air, and looking at
Baby as though he were a Crown Prince, instead of
the youngest nursling in an American flock of five.
While the door was open for nurse and her precious
burden to pass through, sounds of boisterous mirth
floated into the quiet chamber. It was only the
twins, Gay and May, and little Ned—Alice was in
the country—at play in the nursery, but one would
have said that half the children in New York city
were shouting together. The invalid tried to
stifle a sigh which did not escape the father's ear.</p>

<p>"Those torments must go, Elinor!" he exclaimed.
"That is the only way to ensure your recovery."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward, how can I live without my dear
little ones!" murmured the gentle mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Walcott took his wife's transparent hands in
his own and caressed them tenderly. "Do you
want our children's mother to have nerves as much
out of tune as a cracked bell?" said he.</p>

<p>"No."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then they must go to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Not Ned—he is too young to be sent away
from me."</p>

<p>"Very well; Ned shall stay—three servants
may be able to keep him in order! Now let me
see those letters."</p>

<p>Mrs. Walcott drew two letters from beneath her
pillow and passed them to her husband. "Read
them aloud," said she; "I half-read them."</p>

<p>Mr. Walcott drew from one of the envelopes a
single sheet of blue thin paper covered with small
precise characters traced in the blackest of ink,
with the bluntest of quills. As he moved it a
gritty shower fell, showing the writer to be of the
old school which prefers sand to blotting paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My Dear Nephew," Mr. Walcott began, "It
gives me great pain to learn that your dear wife
remains ill. Now, I have a proposition to make;
send Gay up here for a fortnight. His presence
will be inexpressibly grateful to me, and his absence
may be a relief to you at this time. Wire me your
decision. My compliments to Elinor, and believe
me to be,</p>

<p class="quotsig">
"Yours truly,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Harold S. Haines</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"P. S. You may think it singular that I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>not included May in my invitation, but, candidly, a
woman child under my roof would be sufficient
excuse for me to leave it altogether, so I trust you
will understand and pardon my omission. Tell
Elinor that Sarah will take the best of care of the
young rascal.</p>

<p class="right">
"H. S. H."<br />
</p>

<p>"Cedarville, N. Y. Aug. 6, 19——."</p></div>

<p>"A characteristic postscript," laughed Mr.
Walcott. "Uncle Harold's antipathy to 'a petticoat',
as he is fond of calling one of your sex, dear,
seems to increase."</p>

<p>"His antipathy is quite out of proportion to our
little daughter's half-yard petticoat," responded the
Mistress, smiling faintly. "But go on, please, with
Auntie's letter."</p>

<p>The second letter was quite unlike the first; it
was penned in the most delicate handwriting, on
fine white paper, ornamented with a silver crest, and
as Mr. Walcott unfolded it a faint odor of that old-fashioned
scent, lavender, was shed on the air.
"A gentlewoman's letter," one would have said at
once.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Dear Niece Elinor," read Mr. Walcott. "We
were deeply grieved to hear of your protracted
illness, and we are sure that if you were to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>relieved of the care of one of the children your
recovery would be rapid. Will you not send May
to us for a fortnight? You need give yourself no
uneasiness about the dear child's welfare; it will be
Celia's and my pleasure to take the best care of
her. Let us know by telegram when she will leave
New York and we will make arrangements for her
to come from the railway station by the stage that
passes our door—the driver is a most reliable person.
With best wishes for your speedy return to health,
and with kind remembrances to Edward, in which
Celia joins, I am, my dear niece,</p>

<p class="quotsig">
"Your affectionate aunt,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Beulah Linn</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"P. S. Celia suggests that you may think it odd
that we have not included Gay in our invitation, but
the truth is, we should not know what to do with a
lively, noisy boy. We shall enjoy May very much
if she is like Alice, wholly without those failings of
modern childhood—a pert tongue, boisterous manners,
and slang.</p>

<p class="right">
"B. L."<br />
</p>

<p>"Hazelnook, N. Y., Aug. 6, 19——."</p></div>

<p>"It is rather strange, isn't it, Edward, that the
aunts will have none of Gay, while the uncle disdains
May? It will break their hearts to separate
them."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is better so, my dear. Doting father that I
am I cannot deny that Gay and May make a team
that gentle maiden ladies or a quiet old bachelor
would find difficult to manage! Shall I go out
now and wire our good relatives that they may
expect the children to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the Mistress replied, with a sigh of
resignation. "And send Gay and May to me,
please—they will receive their sentence of banishment
best from my lips."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE FIRST SEPARATION</small></h2>


<p>They stole across the nursery floor and through
the hall on tiptoe; because they had promised father
to be "as still as mice."</p>

<p>So far so good! Not the slyest nibbler of cheese
in the house could have moved more softly than
Gay and May. It was the quietest procession that
ever marched until it reached the threshold of the
Mistress's chamber when it fell into wild confusion;
Gay, in his desire to catch the first glimpse of
mother, stepped on May's heel and that made May
scream. It wasn't a loud scream, to be sure, but it
was louder than the most frantic mouse could squeak,
and quite loud enough to rouse the mother from
the light slumber into which she had fallen. She
opened her eyes, then closed them again as she lay
there on her couch so motionless that her children
crept to her side and touched her to see if she slept.
Then she opened her eyes once more and smiled;
not her old joyous smile, but one so faint that Gay's
eyes filled with tears. Taking his mother's pale,
beautiful face between his hands he kissed it gently—not
very gently, perhaps, for a boy's kiss is rarely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>as light as a fairy's, although his heart is quite as
tender—and this won for him a kiss in return.</p>

<p>"We meant to be very quiet, mother," said Gay,
with another penitent kiss. "But something
always happens."</p>

<p>"Yes, something always happens," said May, who
invariably echoed Gay's sentiments and followed
his example, as became a twin sister.</p>

<p>"Mother understands, my darlings," the Mistress
softly murmured.</p>

<p>"It was one of our mishaps," continued Gay.
"You know we can't keep out of them, mother.
When we don't go to them they just follow right
round after us, as if they were alive!"</p>

<p>In truth, it seemed as if this were so. Their
eleven years had been crowded with adventures;
not particularly stirring nor remarkable, but harmless
and ludicrous adventures such as seem to come to
some children unsought. It must be owned, however,
in their case, that had not the adventure appeared
promptly on the scene they would have gone
in search of it, Gay leading and May a close second.
As they apparently led a charmed life, emerging
unscathed from their scrapes, no one was disposed
to criticise them severely. Alice once said:</p>

<p>"Gay and May are just like cats; no matter how
badly they may be placed, when they jump they
always land on their feet!" And the entire family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>regarded this as a figurative, but correct, estimate
of the luck that constantly attended the twins.</p>

<p>Of past pranks little need be said, since it is the
purpose of this story to relate the greatest escapade
of their lives, but it may as well be stated that many
of their mishaps were due to the remarkable resemblance
existing between them.</p>

<p>Gay and May were much more alike than two
peas; they were as identical as two perfectly symmetrical
beads. Cover knickerbockers and jacket,
skirt and bodice, and no one could tell which closely-cropped
head was May's,—which Gay's! In height
they did not vary a hair's breadth. In step and
movement they were precisely the same. In voice
no musician could detect the difference of an infinitesimal
part of a tone. Not a ray of light sparkled
in one pair of hazel eyes that was not reflected in
the other. Even in the wild rose of their cheeks
Dame Nature was careful to preserve the same tint.
Not a dimple, not a smile; not a look, nor a gesture
in one that was not repeated in the other. If there
were mental or moral differences, these were not
noticeable when they were together; both were
healthy, daring, and honest, with hearts for any
fate, providing there was fun enough in it. It is
not singular, therefore, that such striking similarity
in character and appearance produced many complications.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>In their babyhood, Gay wore a pink, and May a
blue ribbon for identification, but, if by chance
these distinguishing marks became displaced, it often
followed that Gay was kissed and coddled for a
girl; while poor May was bounced and tossed and
trotted for a boy. When they were put in short
frocks the same mistakes were made.</p>

<p>"There'll be no such confusion when Gay puts
on trousers," prophesied a sage relative of the family.
Alas! for prophet; when Gay became a real boy
in knickerbockers, the work of confusion still went
on. Indeed, after knickerbockers began to play
their part, it was worse than ever, for the twins
were then old enough to understand the value of
their resemblance in solid fun.</p>

<p>No truthful chronicler of their tricks would undertake
to tell how many times the burden of Gay's
misdoing was accepted by May, who lay demurely
in bed, in broad daylight, in that young worthy's
place, while he escaped to the park, there to sport
in freedom. Nor how Gay took May's dose of
castor oil, the medicine of all others most abhorred
by her; nor how more than once he bore the ten
strokes of the rattan designed for her palm, on his
own, both remedies being administered by nurse,
and received by the culprit or patient, as the case
might be, in a pinafore donned for the occasion.
Gay and May were not model children, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>possessed one splendid trait in common; they shared
alike the pleasure and pain that fell to their lot, for
their hearts were both loyal and generous.</p>

<p>Now let us return to the chamber of the Mistress.
While Gay and May sat at her bedside, trying to
"make her well" by kisses and petting, you may
be sure the mother thought some time of the approaching
separation before mentioning it, but at
length she told them of the invitations they had received
and of their father's wishes.</p>

<p>They heard her through in open-eyed amazement.
Gay looked at May, and May returned the glance;
then they clasped each other and cried together:</p>

<p>"Separate us, mother? It can't be done!"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>JUST FOR FUN</small></h2>


<p>The twins were in the nursery the next morning,
when Jane told them that their father had gone
away at an early hour, on business.</p>

<p>"Thomas will take you to the station," said Jane.</p>

<p>"What dreadful luck!" sighed Gay.</p>

<p>"Perfectly dreadful!" echoed May.</p>

<p>Not that they disliked Thomas. On the contrary,
they liked him very well, but they had anticipated
much pleasure in going to the station in their
father's company; to be deprived of this was to
have their cup of sorrow filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>"You must dress yourselves this morning," continued
Jane. "Nurse is busy with your mother
and I must take care of baby. I've laid out your
clothes; when you are dressed go right down to
breakfast; you've no time to play. Mary has baked
some little muffins for you, and you can have orange
marmalade and raspberry jam, both. Now, make
haste." And busy Jane hurried away.</p>

<p>"Muffins! Does Jane think muffins will make
us happy?" cried Gay, scornfully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>"It was good of Mary to bake them for us," said
May, secretly thinking that hot muffins and marmalade
were sovereign aids to happiness, though she
did not dare to say so to Gay.</p>

<p>"Well, let's hurry up," said Gay, darting, with
the swiftness of a swallow, into his room.</p>

<p>May was more deliberate in her movements, or,
rather, her method of making her toilet differed
somewhat from her brother's. With May, a bath
was a preliminary operation; with Gay, it came last
and could scarcely be called a bath at all, since he
simply dipped his face and hands in the basin, and
ignored the tub altogether, except upon such occasions
as Jane enforced a thorough scrubbing.
Family statistics show this dislike to soap and water
to be a chronic ailment among boys from seven to
fourteen years of age, but Gay always explained it
by saying he was "rushed for time."</p>

<p>May was just pattering in from the bath-room
when Gay emerged from his room fully dressed—more
fully dressed, in fact, than he had been for a
number of years.</p>

<p>"Why, Gay Walcott, you've got on my clothes!"
May cried.</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Gay, piroueting airily around
the room. "Jane must be crazy; she put your
clothes in my room."</p>

<p>May ran into her room. "And yours in here,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>said she. "Come and get them, and give me
mine."</p>

<p>"Try on mine—just for fun," urged Gay.
"We'll see if Jane can tell the difference—which
is which."</p>

<p>"There isn't time," objected May, rather faintly.</p>

<p>"There's lots of time," said Gay, who was
never "rushed" when there was a chance for a
prank.</p>

<p>When May came out of her room wearing Gay's
clothes they stared at each other an instant, then
ran to the mirror and stood before it, side by side,
and stared at their reflections there.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried May, "I am not sure that I am I!"</p>

<p>"You are not you," Gay answered, "you are I,
and I am you. I hear Jane coming! What do
you suppose she'll say?"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" cried Jane, bustling into the
room. "Don't stand there looking into the glass.
Why won't you hurry? You should have been
half through breakfast by this time. Why, how
clean your hands and face are, Master Gay—and I
declare, you've actually brushed your hair!"</p>

<p>Jane looked from one to the other in unfeigned
amazement. May giggled, but neither spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised," Jane began, giving May a
reproving glance. "Your sash isn't straight, Miss
May. Turn around."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>The sash was somewhat awry, for Gay, unaccustomed
to such fripperies, had tied it under his left
shoulder blade. He turned round and Jane fixed
it, then giving his borrowed skirt several twitches,
she said: "Seems to me you don't look quite as
well as usual, Miss May. If you get untidy while
your ma's sick she'll feel awful bad. But run
along, now, to breakfast."</p>

<p>The twins exchanged significant glances: Jane
had not detected them, May was about to exonerate
herself from the charge of untidiness when Gay
whispered: "Don't tell till we've tried it on Thomas
and Mary."</p>

<p>"But——" May commenced.</p>

<p>"Let the goats butt; don't you try it, May!"
said frolicsome Gay, pulling her after him out of
the nursery.</p>

<p>In the dining-room Thomas and breakfast
awaited them.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Thomas," said the mock May,
very glibly.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss," responded unsuspicious
Thomas. "Good morning, Master Gay."</p>

<p>"Good morning," replied the mock boy, not less
glibly than the other conspirator.</p>

<p>"How do you think we look, Thomas," Gay continued;
"as well as usual?"</p>

<p>"You look fine, Miss, fine," Thomas answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>"As for Master Gay there, I've never seen him look
so neat."</p>

<p>This evidence of Thomas's mystification delighted
the twins almost beyond concealment. They would
have betrayed themselves had not Mary, the cook,
appeared upon the scene. She carried two pasteboard
boxes and she gave one to each of the children,
saying, "Yer luncheon, dharlin', for ye'll be
afther gettin' hungry on the cars. There's rolls,
an' ham, an' fowl, an' harrd biled eggs, an'——"</p>

<p>"And little cakes!" interrupted May, with a
scream of delight.</p>

<p>"Yes,—wid icin'," Mary replied, with a broad
smile, for the twins were her especial pets. "But
I niver knew that ye liked cake; I t'ought it was
Miss May what had the swate toot!"</p>

<p>Gay and May smiled appreciatively at Mary's
mistake. They were trying to explain to her that
their gastronomical tastes were similar when nurse
sailed majestically into the room.</p>

<p>"Mary," said she, "h'I'll see you h'in the kitchen.
Thomas, 'urry hup; you must go h'in ten minutes.
Children, Jane wants you h'in the 'all."</p>

<p>Before coming to America, nurse had been under-nurse-maid
in an aristocratic English family, but
from her deportment one would have supposed her
to have been nurse to the Queen's own children.
So majestic, pompous, and domineering was she that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>no one ventured to oppose or question her control.
Therefore, when she ordered the group in the dining-room
to separate they promptly separated without
murmur or ado!</p>

<p>"They never suspected anything!" chuckled
Gay, as he left the room with May. "We really
must try it on mother, then we'll tell."</p>

<p>But Jane's first words when they reached the hall
destroyed all hope of testing the mother.</p>

<p>"You mustn't fuss," Jane began, "you must be
good and not make any trouble, but the doctor says
you can't see your ma before you go."</p>

<p>"Why not?" the twins demanded in one voice.</p>

<p>"Because the doctor says if she gets as nervous
to-day as she did yesterday that he won't answer
for the consequences. She must be kept perfectly
quiet."</p>

<p>"If it's for mother's good——" Gay began.</p>

<p>"It is for her good," Jane said.</p>

<p>"Then we won't fuss," sighed May.</p>

<p>"That's a good fellow," cried Jane, patting the
mock boy's head.</p>

<p>May made up her mouth to tell Jane the truth,
when nurse and Thomas joined them; Thomas, with
Ned on his shoulder, and nurse carrying wraps,
hats, and the lunch-boxes.</p>

<p>"Mercy hun h'us!" nurse exclaimed, "you
h'ought to be h'off now."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>As she spoke she seized the real May, and, before
the child could speak, buttoned her into a jacket
and set a tarpaulin sailor on her head.</p>

<p>The real Gay had his turn next. Nurse shook
him into a light ulster and fastened a straw hat,
trimmed with daisies, on his head by an elastic band
which snapped under his chin with a loud noise.</p>

<p>All this time the twins had been struggling to
speak. "But, nurse," they began, impetuously,
for this was carrying the joke too far, "we——"</p>

<p>"You can say good-by to Ned when you come
'ome," said nurse, who thought they wanted to
waste valuable time in farewells. "H'off with
you!"</p>

<p>The real May was a picture of distress, but her
more volatile brother seized her by the hand and
whispered: "Never mind; it's only keeping up the
lark; I've got the worst of it, too, in these horrid
skirts."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>A REMARKABLE HOUSEHOLD</small></h2>


<p>Everybody in Cedarville knew and respected
General Haines. His ancestors for four generations
had lived and died in the fine old mansion which
he now occupied. The General was commonly considered
a "character." He was dignified in appearance
and irascible in temper; a perfect martinet
on the subject of deportment in the rising generation;
a stern enemy to cowardice and untruthfulness,
while in many other matters he was as impracticable
as a babe and as timorous as an old lady.
His face was bearded and stern; his voice terrible.
Whenever he lost his temper, which was every other
minute, he shouted as though he had been at the
head of an army. His heart was tender withal, and
altogether he was as remarkable a gentleman as one
often meets.</p>

<p>He was unmarried because he had never known
a woman the equal of his mother, whose memory
he adored. He had lived, since his mother's death,
a life of comparative isolation in the old Haines'
mansion, which was conducted as nearly as possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>after the fashion of the last century, for the General
hated innovations. He rarely left home, and he had
not seen the Walcott twins since their babyhood.</p>

<p>In his housekeeper, Sarah, General Haines had a
counterpart to the full as eccentric as himself.
Warm-hearted, quick-tempered, and sharp-tongued,
Sarah was the only person for whom the General
felt wholesome awe. She ruled him completely;
strangely enough she considered him the reverse of
forbidding. This is not so singular, perhaps, in the
light of the fact that the General seldom made a
move without first consulting Sarah; when he did
he generally regretted it!</p>

<p>His letter to Mr. Walcott was an instance where
he had acted without orders, and when his nephew
telegraphed that Gay would arrive on the noon
train from New York, on the 8th of August, the
doughty General realized what he had done. He
had bidden a guest, possibly a troublesome one, to
his house without Sarah's knowledge. No wonder
he trembled and carried Mr. Walcott's telegram
crumpled in his pocket two hours before he mentioned
it!</p>

<p>On the eventful evening that May and Gay received
their sentence of banishment, and at about
the same hour, General Haines paced back and forth
on the broad porch of his house, with the terrible
telegram in his pocket. As he walked, he called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>himself a coward, and declared over and over again
that he would be master in his own house!</p>

<p>This device for promoting courage he repeated
several times, but it would not work. At the end
of a half hour he was no better prepared to face
Sarah than he had been in the beginning. Just as
he was repeating for the fiftieth time the dreadful
fib that he would be master in his own house or
he would know the reason why, Sarah passed the
porch. She wore a white dimity sunbonnet, although
the sun had gone down in the west, and
carried a small watering-pot. She had been giving
her asters a shower-bath by way of encouraging
them to flower early. She did not appear to notice
General Haines.</p>

<p>"Sarah," said the General.</p>

<p>The sunbonneted head turned in his direction,
but there was no other evidence of interest.</p>

<p>"Sarah, let us take tea in the library, this evening,"
the General continued, in what he believed
to be a persuasive tone.</p>

<p>"Very well," came from the depths of the sunbonnet.</p>

<p>The General had intended to speak of the telegram,
but there was something ominous in the
movements of that hidden head, and he decided to
temporize. "Ahem!" he began, "I shall have
something to say to you, then."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus ended the dialogue between the General
and the sunbonnet, for Sarah passed on without
replying.</p>

<p>"I wonder what mischief he's in, now?" she
said to herself, a minute later. "Something, I'll
be bound!"</p>

<p>One would have said that she spoke of a child of
tender years, instead of an old gentleman of sixty,
with a temper so peppery that no one in the village
dared oppose it.</p>

<p>Little maid Phyllis, whose life Sarah made a
burden by perpetual instruction in housewifery,
brought the tea into the library, just as the General
entered. Sarah was already there, seated at the
tea-table, brushing imaginary shreds of lint off the
burnished surface of the copper tea-kettle.</p>

<p>"Phyllis, you should never wipe this kettle with
a cloth that is the least mite damp," Sarah said.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," Phyllis answered.</p>

<p>"You may go," Sarah added.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," and the door closed after Phyllis.
Phyllis' vocabulary was reduced to the single word
"Yes'm;" it was the only word that did not give
offense to her mistress, who had her own views concerning
humility in serving maids.</p>

<p>Sarah at the tea-table made an exceedingly pleasing
picture. Her comely figure was clad in a remarkable
flowered brilliant, of a style so ancient, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>to suggest the thought that she had robbed the
cedar chest of an old-time gentlewoman to procure
it. A fine lawn kerchief and an apron of the same
material completed an attire as picturesque as that
of <em>Mistress This</em> or <em>Dame That</em> in some old
comedy.</p>

<p>Nor was General Haines' appearance less picturesque
than that of his housekeeper. He prided
himself upon being and looking "a gentleman of
the old school." His attire was modeled after that
of his great-grandfather, a redoubtable general of
Washington's time. He wore knee breeches, satin
waistcoat, black silk hose, and low shoes with handsome
buckles. He even went so far in his imitation
of the "old school" as to carry a snuff-box of fine
workmanship, but he was too modern in his taste to
use the snuff.</p>

<p>Picturesque and comely as were these figures at
the tea-table, one at least, was as uncomfortable as
it would be possible for any one to be in clothes of
the latest mode. After three cups of tea General
Haines had not acquired sufficient courage to produce
the telegram that fairly burned in his pocket.
He had hoped that Sarah might be curious enough
to ask what he desired to say to her, but this was
precisely what she did not intend to do. She had
measured lances with the General a good many
times, and knew the transparent tricks he employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>to get the better of her. "If he's got anything to
say let him say it, not try to make me commit myself
before he has opened his head!" her thoughts
ran.</p>

<p>At length he had to "say it," and he began,—</p>

<p>"I—expect—I expect a—a—boy on the noon
train to-morrow!" He tried to speak carelessly,
just as if he had been in daily receipt of boys by
the noon train for years!—but his attempt was not
a success, and he knew it.</p>

<p>"So that's what he's been up to!" thought Sarah.
She said, "We don't need a boy; we've help enough
on the place."</p>

<p>"He isn't help, he's a visitor."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"My grand nephew."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"His mother is the lady whose portrait hangs in
my study."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>It was plain that Sarah was deeply offended.
She rose and swept toward the door like a tragedy
queen, and the General did not venture to ask her
to remain.</p>

<p>"I should think," she said, pausing on the
threshold, "that you would know by this time—deep
emphasis on "this time,"—"that I am not
always ready for a great houseful of company."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>"Great houseful of company!" shouted the
General, who had kept his temper as long as he
was able. "One small boy is not 'a houseful of
company,' madam!"</p>

<p>"He is worse!" retorted Sarah, "one small boy
is worse than a barrel of monkeys!—you will
see!"</p>

<p>She went out, closing the door after her with
considerable unnecessary force—it would have been
a genuine slam in one of less mature years—leaving
the General wiping his brow with his flowered silk
handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>MORE CONFUSION</small></h2>


<p>Notwithstanding their somewhat tragic departure
the twins did not remain depressed; their
spirits soon rose until they forgot their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôles</i> and
addressed one another by the right name, much to
the confusion of Thomas, who finally asked, "What
ailed their tongues?"</p>

<p>"We forgot to change them this morning when
we changed our clothes," answered audacious Gay.</p>

<p>"I believe ye, Miss," said Thomas, not at all
realizing what he was saying.</p>

<p>At the railway station, however, their spirits fell
again, and while Thomas bought their tickets Gay
and May reviewed the situation.</p>

<p>"We must just brave it out," said Gay, gloomily,
for the prospect was less pleasing than at first.
"It wouldn't do to go home and disturb mother and
she'd be sure to hear of it; then what would the
doctor say?"</p>

<p>"If we were only going together!" sighed May.
"But just fancy me at Cedarville and Uncle Harold
thinking I'm a boy!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>"Fancy me," said Gay, "trying to be lady-like
and the aunties not knowing that I'm a boy!"</p>

<p>"You can't be lady-like," laughed May.</p>

<p>"You can't be manly!" retorted Gay.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish we were ourselves again!" May
said.</p>

<p>"The train is ready, Master Gay," said Thomas,
returning with the tickets and checks.</p>

<p>The real boy sprang to his feet, then sat down
in confusion, remembering that he had no outward
claim to the name of Gay.</p>

<p>"You may go, too, Miss May," said innocent
Thomas; "your train leaves on the next track."</p>

<p>They went on board the train together and
Gay chose a seat for May near the center of
the car and back of one occupied by a boy of
their age.</p>

<p>"He'll be company for you," whispered Gay.</p>

<p>Just then the conductor came along and Thomas
spoke to him.</p>

<p>"This is Master Gay Walcott, who is going to
Cedarville; will you be kind enough to look out for
him, sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the conductor, nodding
pleasantly and walking away.</p>

<p>Both children returned the conductor's bow; the
real Gay because he again forgot, and the mock
Gay because she meant to be gentlemanly. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>a little mortifying, therefore, to have the real Gay
whisper,—</p>

<p>"You mustn't forget to take off your hat, next
time."</p>

<p>"I thought you might like a book, Master Gay,"
said Thomas, taking a bright-colored volume from
his pocket.</p>

<p>Both children made a dive for it.</p>

<p>"Not so fast!" said Thomas. "This is Master
Gay's."</p>

<p>The real Gay drew back with a giggle. He had
made one more mistake.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" the mock Gay cried, giving
Thomas a kiss, quite forgetting that a genuine boy
never kisses when he is pleased!</p>

<p>"This is yours, Miss May," Thomas said, taking
another book from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the mock May.</p>

<p>"What, no kiss for me, Miss?" said Thomas.
Then the boy in the petticoats had to kiss
Thomas, though it went against the grain to do it.</p>

<p>A low laugh attracted their attention. It fell
from the widely parted lips of the boy in front of
them; he was much amused at what was going on.</p>

<p>"You won't like him," said Gay promptly.
"He's a frightful cad, I'm sure; it shows through
on the outside. Let's get another seat."</p>

<p>But a brakeman shouted "All aboard" just then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>and the change of seats was not made. The twins
embraced hastily; May with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't cry!" whispered mischievous Gay.
"Boys never cry; remember that."</p>

<p>"Good bye, master Gay," said Thomas. "Be a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"I'll try," answered the mock boy, dragging off
the tarpaulin sailor hat right gallantly.</p>

<p>Then they were gone, and no sooner was the
masquerader left to her fate than the boy in front
commenced to make talk,—</p>

<p>"My name is Philip Guy Brentwood,—what is
yours?"</p>

<p>"Miss Walcott," May answered with great dignity
and entire forgetfulness of her part.</p>

<p>"'Miss' Walcott? That's a queer name for a
boy! Where are you going, Miss Walcott?"</p>

<p>"To Cedarville."</p>

<p>"I may see you there, although I don't associate
with everybody in Cedarville. My grandpapa, Dr.
Brentwood, is the biggest man there."</p>

<p>"How big is he?" May asked, with eager
interest. "As big as a dime museum man?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that kind of big; he's the richest
man in Cedarville."</p>

<p>"He is a cad," thought May.</p>

<p>"Are you going to board in Cedarville?" questioned
inquisitive Philip Guy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>"I shall visit my uncle, General Haines."</p>

<p>"He's a queer duck. You won't have any fun
there. Who were those people with you?"</p>

<p>"My brother and our man-servant, Thomas."</p>

<p>Philip laughed. "Your brother?" he repeated.
"Is that pretty little girl your brother?"</p>

<p>"That's another mistake!" thought May. "It's
getting worse and worse!"</p>

<p>"I say," Philip continued. "You kissed that
man; you must be an awful sissy to kiss men."</p>

<p>Truly, it was getting "worse and worse!" A
real boy would have known how to put an end to
this inquisition, but May was merely an unsuccessful
imitation of a boy. A desire to be courteous and
a determination not to be bullied by Philip strove
for ascendency in May's mind; the latter undoubtedly
would have won had not the conductor
passed along just then.</p>

<p>"Conductor!" cried May. "Will you take me
into another car, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Master Walcott," the conductor replied.</p>

<p>Then, much to Philip's astonishment, May followed
the conductor into the next car. Neither
child scored a victory, but May was not beaten,
thanks to the girl's quick brain under the boy's
hat.</p>

<p>The conductor proved a more agreeable traveling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>companion than Philip, and the ride to Cedarville,
which was not long, was a pleasant one.</p>

<p>General Haines' man-servant was awaiting
Gay's arrival, and as they were about to drive
away from the station, Philip came up to the carriage.</p>

<p>"You ran away because you were afraid!" he
cried, mockingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," May replied, "I was 'afraid' that I
should have to talk to you."</p>

<p>Philip did not appear to be offended at this plain
speaking. "You're not such a slow sort, after all,"
said he, patronizingly.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Philip asked another question:</p>

<p>"Is Miss—your name—the short for Mississippi?</p>

<p>"No, the short for Mischief!" retorted May, by
way of a parting shot.</p>

<p>No one was visible when they reached the General's,
but the man told May to "go in." The outside
door was open and a tall man, dressed in what
May thought to be livery, was in the hall. Toward
this person she advanced boldly, despite his forbidding
aspect.</p>

<p>"Butler," said May, "will you tell General
Haines that Ma—Gay Walcott is here?"</p>

<p>"Butler!" thundered the General, for of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>it was he. "You young scapegrace, what do you
mean by such impudence?"</p>

<p>"It was a mistake. I beg your pardon, sir."</p>

<p>This apology, made in May's most deferential
manner, did not appease the General's wrath. He
immediately detected a fresh cause for offense.</p>

<p>"Where is your hat?" he demanded, with a
fierce frown. "Bless me! A Walcott to keep on
his hat in the presence of a superior!"</p>

<p>May pulled off the offending tarpaulin and made
a prim little bow, but the General ignored this tardy
evidence of breeding and walked away, leaving his
abashed young visitor alone in the great oak hall.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>BEING A BOY</small></h2>


<p>Sarah and Phyllis were in the dining-room when
the General burst in.</p>

<p>"He's here!" he announced, in much the tone
of voice he might have used in speaking of the
advent of a formidable enemy.</p>

<p>"Who's here? Oh, that boy! Where is he?"
asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"In the hall—he will be a great disappointment
to you."</p>

<p>"He won't be a disappointment to me. I never
took any stock in him at any time."</p>

<p>"He is wholly without manners. Kept on his
hat, and took me for a butler!"</p>

<p>Sarah laughed outright. "What a droll little
lad!" she said.</p>

<p>"Do you think it 'droll' for a young jackanapes
to insult me?"</p>

<p>"No insult about it," replied Sarah, whose feelings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>toward the visitor seemed to have taken a sudden
change. "Natural mistake—your outlandish
clothes——"</p>

<p>"'Outlandish clothes!'" gasped the General.</p>

<p>"That is what I said," answered Sarah, composedly.</p>

<p>"Outlandish—!" The General did not complete
the sentence; his emotions overcame him and he
left the room.</p>

<p>"Phyllis, see where that boy is!" commanded
Sarah.</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Make him comfortable till I come."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>May was sitting on the stairs, waiting to learn
her fate in this strange household, when Phyllis
appeared.</p>

<p>"Poor little fellow!" thought Phyllis, moved
by the picture of woe May unconsciously made.
Aloud, she asked,—</p>

<p>"Are you General Haines' nephew?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I am at present."</p>

<p>"Miss Sarah will be along in a minute," said
Phyllis, thinking that May's peculiar remark was
due to confusion.</p>

<p>"Who is Miss Sarah?" May asked, in alarm.
"Is she—another?"</p>

<p>Phyllis' eyes twinkled. "Yes," said she. "Miss
Sarah is another!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>"Is she like the General?" May ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"The General is a baby beside her."</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do?" And May clasped her
hands and gazed entreatingly into her companion's
kind face.</p>

<p>"She'll like you fast enough, if the General
doesn't," Phyllis said, consolingly. "That's her
way—what he likes she doesn't; what he doesn't
like she thinks a heap of."</p>

<p>"What very queer people," May said.</p>

<p>"I guess you'd think so, if you worked for 'em!"
Then reflecting that it was neither loyal nor politic
to speak so freely of her employers, Phyllis added,
"Not that they are not nice in their way."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd like their way," May said, with
a decided shake of her head.</p>

<p>"What would you like to do?" Phyllis inquired,
mindful of Sarah's injunction to make the boy
comfortable.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go home, but I suppose I shall have
to stay till mother's better," May replied, dolefully.</p>

<p>"Come, now, don't look so sober," said Phyllis,
pleasantly. "I know a real nice place in the orchard,
and we'll go there. I go by myself whenever I can
get my work done. That isn't often," with a sigh.
"Miss Sarah is one o' the kind that doesn't believe
in getting work done; she keeps me doing it."</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" cried May, who didn't know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>that Phyllis' comment on Sarah's disposition would
apply perfectly to many another notable housewife.</p>

<p>"Here she comes," said Phyllis, softly.</p>

<p>May followed the direction of Phyllis' gaze with
eager interest, and when she saw an attractive
figure in wonderful attire advancing toward them,
she cried, unwarily,—</p>

<p>"What a lovely, lovely dress! I wish I had one
like it."</p>

<p>While Phyllis was pondering this extraordinary
feminine remark May sprang forward to meet
Sarah, who was so favorably impressed with this
impulsive movement that she shook hands with the
General's young relative very cordially, saying,
pleasantly,—</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Gay. I hope you will
enjoy your visit here."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'm sure I shall if I may stay with
you and Phyllis a good deal," May responded, with
a bright smile.</p>

<p>Sarah smiled also; she knew that the boy was
too polite to add, "and not with the General!"</p>

<p>"You may go with Phyllis now," said Sarah.
"Phyllis, lay the table for lunch—and mind, no
wrinkles in the under cloth."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"May I help?" begged May. "Thomas often
lets me. My brother puts on knives and forks as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>well as Thomas can, and I can do everything—side
table and all. But that isn't so strange for me as
it would be for a boy."</p>

<p>"For a boy?" Sarah looked dazed. "What are
you but a boy?"</p>

<p>May's head dropped. "I don't really know—I'm
not much of a boy," she faltered.</p>

<p>"You are enough of one not to be allowed to
meddle with my china," laughed Sarah.</p>

<p>This evidence that Sarah did not suspect the
truth was so gratifying that May, much to Sarah's
surprise, clasped her affectionately around the waist
and put up her face to be kissed. This embrace
was witnessed with horror by Phyllis, who could
not imagine any one safely taking such liberties
with her mistress; her horror changed to astonishment
when Sarah returned the caress.</p>

<p>"The world must be coming to an end," thought
Phyllis, as she went into the dining room, with May
at her heels. "I never saw Miss Sarah so melted—like—somebody
will have to pay for it! She's like
a pair of scales: when one is up in her opinion
somebody else is way down."</p>

<p>When the young people were gone the General
appeared at the library door; curiosity had conquered
outraged dignity.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He's a very nice boy," Sarah said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>"Manners of a clown!" growled the General.</p>

<p>"Very pretty manners," chirped Sarah, "modest
and affectionate."</p>

<p>"What business has a boy with affectionate
manners? A boy should have the manners of a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Of the 'old school?'" inquired Sarah, saucily.</p>

<p>"Certainly not of the modern school, Madam!"</p>

<p>When General Haines addressed Sarah as Madam
he was very indignant indeed, and Sarah rarely
replied, but upon this occasion silence was not what
the General wanted.</p>

<p>"What did the young savage say to you?" the
General questioned.</p>

<p>"He asked if he might help lay the table."</p>

<p>"Help lay the table?" the General roared. "He
is a molly-cott, Madam, as well as a clown! To
think a boy with a single drop of Haines blood in
his veins should want to lay a table!—But he shall
not do it!—he shall not ape the ways of a petticoat
while under my roof."</p>

<p>"Miss Sarah," cried May, "I came to tell you
that cook let me put the potatoes in the kettle—I
hope you don't object to that!"</p>

<p>May stood in the dining-room door, a white apron
pinned over jacket and knickerbockers, and the
sight of the badge of feminine neatness exasperated
the General anew.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;"><a id="i_042fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_042fp.jpg" width="469" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"TAKE OFF THAT APRON," SHOUTED THE GENERAL</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>"Take off that rag!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Run out and take off the apron, as the General
bids you," Sarah said.</p>

<p>And May ran.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell him to go out and change that
cloth."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"I must remind you, Madam, that he is my
nephew and I shall not permit him to go about
dressed like a girl in my house."</p>

<p>"And I must remind you that the boy is your
guest, at your invitation, and I shall not permit you
to terrify and oppress him."</p>

<p>The General glared at Sarah and Sarah returned
his look. Then Sarah nodded her head emphatically
and the General did the same. There was no more
said, but it looked as if the masquerader's position
in the Haines household was likely to be one of no
little importance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>BEING A GIRL</small></h2>


<p>"It is perfectly horrid to be a girl," Gay said to
himself, as the train steamed away toward Hazelnook.
"I always thought that the first time I
traveled alone I'd ask to ride on the engine; now
I can't do it because I've got on these old skirts!
I hope May won't suffer so being a boy. I——"</p>

<p>Gay's reverie was interrupted by an exclamation,</p>

<p>"Why, that must be little May Walcott!"</p>

<p>"She's taken in, too. Here's some fun, perhaps,"
thought naughty Gay, turning in the direction
whence the voice had come. In the seat behind
were two ladies; a pretty matron and a young girl,
toward whom Gay was instantly attracted.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember Mrs. Dayton, who visits
your mamma?" said the matron.</p>

<p>Gay sprang up, dragged the daisy-trimmed hat
off and bowed, then instead of returning the hat to
his head he held it in his hand, with his small thumb
curved over the brim. It was an absurd position
for a girl, but neither lady noticed it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>"This is Miss Maud Berkeley," said Mrs. Dayton.
"You may have heard your Uncle George speak of
her."</p>

<p>"He never said a word to me about Miss Berkeley."
Gay looked aggrieved. It was unkind of
Uncle George—a favorite uncle—not to have mentioned
such a lovely lady.</p>

<p>"You have not told us how your mamma is?"
continued Mrs. Dayton.</p>

<p>"She is very sick. That's why we were sent
away—my twin sister and I."</p>

<p>"Sister?" exclaimed Mrs. Dayton. "I didn't
know you were both girls: I thought one was a
boy."</p>

<p>"One is a boy," Gay admitted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dayton trod no further on this delicate
ground, much to Gay's relief. The conductor
passed along and she hailed him.</p>

<p>"Will you turn this seat over, please?" said
she. "Now, May, you can sit with us."</p>

<p>Gay rose rather reluctantly. "It's awful,"
thought the little fraud. "I know she'll find it all
out, but father always says, 'Be polite to ladies, no
matter what it costs,' and I'm not going to forget
to be polite just because I'm playing be a girl."</p>

<p>Then Gay slipped into the proffered seat, hat in
hand, just as father did when he joined ladies!</p>

<p>"Her manners are just like a boy's," murmured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Mrs. Dayton, in the perfectly audible tone that
grown people often employ in the presence of children—just
as though they must be deaf because
they are young.</p>

<p>"She is a dear," returned Miss Maud. "George
often speaks of her."</p>

<p>At the mention of Uncle George's name Gay
asked,—</p>

<p>"Isn't my Uncle George a rattling good fellow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," concurred Miss Maud, with a pretty blush.</p>

<p>"He's the jolliest fellow! He gave me boxing
gloves, a baseball bat and Indian clubs for Christmas."</p>

<p>"What strange gifts to a girl!" Mrs. Dayton
remarked.</p>

<p>"He gave my sister the same as he gave me—all
except the bat. He didn't give her one, although
she's a tip-top player, because he thinks baseball
isn't a game for girls."</p>

<p>"But he gave you a bat," said Mrs. Dayton, in
a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"Y—es," faltered Gay, in great confusion.
Here a bright idea flashed through the little rogue's
brain. "He may be partial to me. I may give
the bat to baby; he's going to be a splendid fellow.
Nurse says his muscle is as fine now as little Lord
Roslyn's was when he was six months old. Lord
Roslyn was the little nobleman that lived with nurse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>in her castle in England. We're going to name
baby, George—that ought to help make him a jolly
little kid, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Miss Maud thinks so," said Mrs. Dayton, quizzically.</p>

<p>"Does my Uncle George know that you like him
so well, Miss Maud? If he doesn't I'll tell him, if
you like."</p>

<p>"He—knows it," faltered Miss Berkeley.</p>

<p>"Some day, perhaps, your Uncle George will give
you Miss Maud for an auntie," said Mrs. Dayton,
who evidently enjoyed teasing her friend.</p>

<p>"Did he say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Dayton.</p>

<p>"Are you sure he wasn't fooling?—Uncle
George is awfully full of fun."</p>

<p>"Do you think he was fooling, dear?" inquired
Mrs. Dayton.</p>

<p>"Will you have a wedding, Miss Maud?" Gay
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," Miss Berkeley admitted, with a charming
blush.</p>

<p>"I hope it won't be till I'm grown up, and perhaps
Uncle George will ask me to be an usher."</p>

<p>"You queer little chicken!" cried Mrs. Dayton.
"You mean bridesmaid; girls are never ushers."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Gay.</p>

<p>After this the ladies talked together until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>train reached Hazelnook. When Gay was preparing
to leave the car Miss Berkeley said,—</p>

<p>"Will you not kiss me good-by?"</p>

<p>Gay hesitated. "Uncle George mightn't like
it," he said. "He's awfully particular about the
things that belong to him." Then the masquerader
dropped his mask altogether, and a soft kiss fell on
the lady's ungloved hand. "That makes me your
knight—I'm mother's too."</p>

<p>"I accept your allegiance," said Miss Berkeley,
simply; but there was such a strange expression in
her eyes that guilty Gay made a sudden rush for
the door.</p>

<p>"She suspects me!" thought the culprit. "She's
too much of a brick to tell, though, so I'm safe."</p>

<p>An instant later Gay regretted this rash assertion.
In jumping off the car-steps the horrid skirts caught
and he fell into Uncle George's arms just as that
young gentleman was about to board the train.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Uncle George, staring slightly,
"what are you doing here?"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>A SCENE AT ROSE COTTAGE</small></h2>


<p>"Where are you going? Have you lost your
tongue, Brownie?"</p>

<p>"Brownie" was Uncle George's name for the
real May, and the mock May heard it with great
pleasure, for it proved that there was no danger of
discovery.</p>

<p>"I am going to visit Aunt Linn till mother is
better," Gay answered.</p>

<p>"Where is Gay?"</p>

<p>"He was invited to Cedarville," said the unblushing
young rogue. "What are you doing up here?"</p>

<p>"Business, Brownie."</p>

<p>"Did you expect to find it on the train, Uncle
George?" said audacious Gay, "and is the first
letter of its name M? Miss Maud is awfully sweet,
isn't she?—and almost as pretty as mother."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Uncle George, with great
gravity. "By the way," he added, "you may need
a little extra money while you are here," and he
dropped some silver in Gay's outstretched palm,
and jumped on the last car as the train moved out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>of the station, and nodded his farewell from the
platform.</p>

<p>"Thanks, awfully," shouted Gay. If this was
Uncle George's way of showing his appreciation of
the compliment to Miss Berkeley, it was an exceedingly
agreeable way, and one to be recommended to
all uncles in love.</p>

<p>"Fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety cents!"
counted Gay. "If I stay two weeks I can spend—let
me see, twelve—for there'll be two Sundays
when I can't spend anything—twelve in ninety
goes seven times and a fraction. That's almost
eight cents a day!"</p>

<p>Then he pulled up his skirt, but the pocket
wasn't there!</p>

<p>"My!" he exclaimed, looking around to see if
anybody had noticed his mistake. "How a fellow
does forget that he isn't a boy when he's trying to
be a girl!"</p>

<p>"Goin' to Miss Linn's?" drawled a voice at
Gay's elbow.</p>

<p>A tall, lank man, on whose hatchet-like face an
expression of good humor rested as if it belonged
there, was standing near, leaning lazily on his whip-handle.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going there; I had nearly forgotten it."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't a-let you forget it long. I'm the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>driver of the stage and I don't let passengers forget
to ride with me; that wouldn't be business.
Besides, Miss Linn she asked me to look out for
you—and I guess you need it—you look lively for
a girl."</p>

<p>Gay smiled at this sally. This man was jolly
enough to be in a book! If there were others like
him a visit to Hazelnook wouldn't be so dull.</p>

<p>"Ready?" asked the driver.</p>

<p>"Yes. That's my box down there—the leather
one, and here's the check. I'll help you with the
box—I've great muscle."</p>

<p>"Wall! Wall! I ruther guess you're the queerest
young lady I ever see! 'Great muscle' have ye?
Wall, come along."</p>

<p>Miss Linn's guest helped the driver carry the
leather box to the stage. The sight would not have
delighted the refined old lady's eyes, but Gay was
very well pleased to be of so much assistance, and
insisted upon rendering further service in lifting
other luggage.</p>

<p>"Will you get in, miss?" said the driver, when
the last box was placed.</p>

<p>"I'll get up, if you please."</p>

<p>"Shall I give you a leg up, miss?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no!" laughed Gay, scrambling up
and sitting down in triumph beside the other
passenger, a solemn-faced man, who looked like a
prig and was one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>"You help yourself pretty well," said the driver,
as he took the vacant place at Gay's side.</p>

<p>"A fellow soon gets used to helping himself,"
replied Gay, carelessly, though inwardly well
pleased at the driver's compliment.</p>

<p>"Fellow!" repeated the driver, greatly amused
at such boyish manners. "You're a gay one—and
you're as spry as they come."</p>

<p>"I'm the best performer on the horizontal bar at
my gymnasium."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you was."</p>

<p>"I'm going to pitch for our nine when I go back
home. I tell you the fellows don't get on to my
curves without some study."</p>

<p>"My boy Lyman's crazy over ball. I can't get
a stroke of work out of him. So you play ball, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and football, too," said Gay, carried out
of all remembrance of the behavior entailed by
skirts and a Gainsborough hat trimmed with daisies.
"I generally play half-back," he added.</p>

<p>This was more than the prig could bear in silence.
"I have a little girl at home," said he; "she is
about your age, but she doesn't kick football, nor
play ball, nor swing on the horizontal bar."</p>

<p>"Is she sick—or a cripple?" asked Gay, with
polite interest.</p>

<p>"She is a lady," the prig answered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>"She must be like our Alice," said Gay, ignoring
the prig's sarcasm. "Alice is so quiet and nice
that mother often allows her in the drawing-room
when there's a tea or anything. Alice is pretty;
her hair is long and the color of molasses candy,
and Jane braids it for her and ties it with ribbons.
And she has little feet, and little, cunning hands,
and she wears kid gloves all the time. But my
twin sister is the dandy; Alice isn't a patch on her.
She'll stand anything without a whimper. Sand!
well, I should say so. She'll face the hottest ball
without a wink. She's a boss sprinter—you ought
to see her take her three hundred yards!—and she
never did a mean thing in her life."</p>

<p>The prig was dumb with amazement when Gay
finished this remarkable speech; he could only
congratulate himself that his little daughter was
not there to hear it.</p>

<p>"I wish I might drive," said Gay, with a wistful
glance at the reins.</p>

<p>"So ye can," returned the driver. "It's a
straight piece, now, clean to Miss Linn's."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Gay, gathering up the reins
in small brown hands as steady as the driver's own.
He drove with many a loud, exultant crack of the
whip, guiding the horses with more flourishes than
a veteran member of a coaching club, over the
smooth country road, past the village shops and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>post-office, at a smart trot, and up the lane that led
to the prig's house as fast as the horses could trot.
The prig climbed down over the side of the coach
and paid his fare with ill-concealed reluctance; he
had been bounced and jolted by the objectionable
young romp on the box until his bones and his
temper were alike affected. He said "Good afternoon,"
as if he had been speaking an eternal farewell,
and one that gave him considerable satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Now how much further is it?" Gay inquired,
as the door closed behind the prig.</p>

<p>"That's Rose Cottage, your aunt's place, down
yonder," the driver replied, pointing to a house
not far distant.</p>

<p>"So near!" sighed Gay. "If I had known it I
would have pulled up the horses a little and pieced
out the drive."</p>

<p>In summer everybody in Hazelnook receives
callers on the porch, and Miss Linn and Miss Celia
were entertaining the judge's mother, the doctor's
wife, and the minister on the vine-embowered porch
of Rose Cottage when the stage drove up, Gay still
handling the reins.</p>

<p>"Auntie! See me!" Gay cried. "I've driven
half the way. It is awfully jolly to sit up here and
the driver let me use the whip—use it, not just
crack it—twice!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Linn looked at Miss Celia, Miss Celia looked
at the judge's mother, the judge's mother looked
at the doctor's wife, and she looked in her turn at
the minister, who was too much astonished to look
at any one!</p>

<p>Finally, Miss Celia said,—</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to get down, my dear?"</p>

<p>Gay rose rather reluctantly; he had hoped to be
permitted to drive the horses to the stable, which
was a good half-mile back on the road. "Good-by,"
he said, grasping the driver's hand; "I hope
I shall see you soon, and Lyman, too. I'll come
round to your stable and see the Holstein cattle
you told me about—they must be immense, particularly
the yearling. I never had such a good
drive in my life."</p>

<p>After this cordial farewell Gay dropped like a
ripe plum off the side of the coach to the ground.
Off came the daisy-wreathed hat, then he drew his
heels well together and bowed profoundly. It was
a salute that would have delighted General Haines'
military soul, but it did not please the group on the
porch. Miss Linn, Miss Celia, the judge's mother,
the doctor's wife and the minister rose and stood in
a row, like dahlias,—<em>but no one spoke a word</em>!</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>SAW AND AXE.</small></h2>


<p>"Celia," said Miss Linn, the next day, "I
understand it perfectly; Elinor has been sick so
much that the younger children have been left with
the servants and this is the result. Now we must
make May over."</p>

<p>Miss Linn and Miss Celia were sewing in their
morning room. They were old-fashioned gentlewomen,
not altogether in touch with modern habits
and they held to their needlework of a forenoon as
religiously as though it had been a practise ordained
by a bishop, and when Miss Linn said, "We must
make May over," she spoke as though the petticoated
fraud was a misfit garment.</p>

<p>Now Miss Celia never opposed the will or wishes
of her elder sister. Contradiction was not a weapon
to be used with stately Miss Linn, who was, in the
phrase of their servant, Margery, "terrible sot in
her way!" But Miss Celia did venture to say,—</p>

<p>"May is a trifle hoydenish, perhaps, but time will
remove that blemish from her bearing without our
assistance, sister."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>"She is incorrigible!" sighed Miss Linn. "I
saw her this morning jumping over the fence—the
front fence! Of course I stopped that, but when
I asked her if she wasn't ashamed, she said, 'No'm,
that's the best standing jump I ever made!' I
admit I can't understand how Elinor's daughter
can be such a tomboy!"</p>

<p>"We have left youth far behind us, Beulah;
you must remember that. We can't realize just
what it is to be young and full of life."</p>

<p>"I like a girl to have some sense of propriety.
May is entirely without any. I saw her not an
hour ago with her arm around Patsy Dunn's neck.
I called her into the house at once and told her
that it was highly improper for her to be so familiar
with boys. What do you think she said?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine."</p>

<p>"'Patsy is a dandy, auntie! I'd like to put on the
gloves with him!' I didn't understand what she
meant, but I took her desire for gloves to be a favorable
omen and I told her I hoped she would put
on gloves and keep them on all the time when she
was out of doors. But I doubt if she will do it—she
only laughed and said she hadn't 'quite sand
enough for that'—whatever that means."</p>

<p>Miss Celia groped for the meaning of this speech
and failing to grasp it said nothing, but sewed on
diligently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>"My mind is made up," continued Miss Linn.
"That girl shall be made over before she goes
home to Elinor. I have planned it all out. I
never closed my eyes last night!—and I shall begin
at once."</p>

<p>"What is your plan?"</p>

<p>"You will see," said Miss Linn, mysteriously.
She laid her sewing aside and rang a small silver
bell, peremptorily.</p>

<p>A moment later old Margery appeared at the
door. "Did you ring, mem?"</p>

<p>"Where is Miss May?"</p>

<p>"In the back yard, mem," answered Margery
with reluctance that did not escape Miss Linn's
keen eyes.</p>

<p>"What is she doing?"</p>

<p>Margery hesitated. Tale-bearing was against
her principles, but no one hesitated long before
replying to Miss Linn, and the old servant answered,
"She's helping John saw wood, mem."</p>

<p>If a bombshell had exploded in that quiet room
the effect upon the Misses Linn could not have
been more startling.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Celia? Is that merely a
little hoydenish? Margery, send Miss May to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, mem," answered Margery, wishing with
all her heart that she had not heard Miss Linn's
bell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>When Gay flashed into the room a moment later
both aunts were sewing composedly and neither
looked up immediately. Wasting time in the house
when the outside world was flooded with August
sunshine was not to Gay's taste, but politeness
demanded it, so he shifted from one foot to the
other like an uneasy chicken, until Miss Linn said,—</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Gay, with emphasis that said, "I
will but I don't want to."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing?" questioned Miss
Linn.</p>

<p>"Sawing wood," Gay replied, animatedly. "I
can saw a stick quite straight. Did you ever try
to saw wood, Aunt Beulah?"</p>

<p>Miss Linn did not answer at once; such a question
deprived her of speech, but at length she said,—</p>

<p>"Most assuredly not."</p>

<p>"I think you'd like it," said Gay, with increasing animation.
"First you put your saw on the stick
and it wobbles all around before you can make it
stay anywhere. Then, when you have made a little
place for the saw, the saw sticks right in it and you
pull and up comes the stick and your foot flies off
it! Then you begin again and work a little way
into the stick and everything goes beautifully till
you strike a knot or something and the old saw
won't budge an inch! So you lift it out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>hole and begin again—sawing wood is all beginning
again; that's the way it's done and pretty, soon
away goes the saw, squealing and creaking, and
you are so excited at that time that you work away
like mad, and, then, all of a sudden the saw goes
through, with a sort of surprise and you go on top
of it, the stick falls apart—and there you are!"</p>

<p>As Gay illustrated his description as he gave it,
using a Venetian dagger for a saw, a Swiss paper-cutter
for a stick of wood and a Fayal foot-stool for
a saw-horse, the ladies were clearly instructed in
the mysteries of wood sawing.</p>

<p>"My dear niece," said Miss Linn, slowly and impressively,
"sawing wood is not a fitting employment
for a little girl who wants to be a lady when
she grows up. I suppose that is what you aspire
to be, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Gay's eyes twinkled in appreciation of the situation,
as he said,—</p>

<p>"I don't think I care anything about it; and I
don't think I could be a lady if I tried."</p>

<p>"But you are willing to try?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll try," said Gay, still dimpling.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Linn was so agitated by this brief encounter
with her supposed niece that she resolved
to postpone the "making over," so she said,—</p>

<p>"You may go out again, but you must not saw
any more wood."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not just one stick?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Very well, Aunt Beulah."</p>

<p>When Gay left the room Miss Linn said, meekly,—</p>

<p>"I really don't know where to begin with her!"</p>

<p>"She has one excellent trait, Beulah; she obeys
without question or rebellion."</p>

<p>"I must think about it," said Miss Linn, referring,
of course, to "making May over."</p>

<p>But the good lady did not have an opportunity
to think about it then; a loud shriek ran through
the house, and Margery ran into the room, crying,—</p>

<p>"She's cut off her foot! She's cut off her foot!"</p>

<p>The ladies followed Margery through the house
into the back yard, where they saw Gay dancing
wildly around on one foot, holding the other up
with both hands.</p>

<p>"May, didn't you promise me not to saw wood?"</p>

<p>"I didn't saw it; I chopped it."</p>

<p>"There is no difference," said Miss Linn, meaning
in the spirit of the offense.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there is; you do one with a saw and
the other with an ax!"</p>

<p>Then the hopping ceased suddenly; Gay sank
to the ground and there was a great flurry. John
ran for the doctor, and Margery bore Gay up-stairs,
into the little, white guest-chamber, and laid him
on the bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>A COURSE OF TRAINING</small></h2>


<p>May was watering Sarah's asters when Phyllis
joined her.</p>

<p>"Phyllis!" cried the delighted young gardener,
"I am going to take the whole care of the asters.
Think of that! Oh, I like living here ever so
much."</p>

<p>"The General wants you right away," said
Phyllis.</p>

<p>All the light died out of May's face at these
words.</p>

<p>"What can he want of me, Phyllis?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what he wants," said Phyllis, not
very encouragingly. "But you must be a little
man and meet him like one."</p>

<p>May's face was sad as she said,—</p>

<p>"I shall never be a man and I wish I had never
tried to be a boy."</p>

<p>"As long as you are a boy you ought to try to
be a manly one," said Phyllis, who played the
mentor excellently. "You don't want your brothers
and sisters to be ashamed of you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>This was the right chord to touch.</p>

<p>"I won't be a coward if I can help it. My
brother always said I had as much pluck as he had,
but it has all leaked out somewhere since I've seen
Uncle Harold," May said, dolefully.</p>

<p>"The General isn't very terrible—you must just
face him right down," replied Phyllis.</p>

<p>This was like telling a mouse to go right up to
an elephant and scare him, but it buoyed up May's
spirits considerably. She stopped, however, as
often as possible in going to the house to make the
way seem longer, and at the hall door she made a
long pause.</p>

<p>"It isn't that I'm really a coward," the poor
child thought. "But I'm not used to being treated
as if I had done something awful. And when he
shouts at me I forget all about acting like a boy
I'm so frightened. But there's no use in putting
it off; I've got to go in and take it."</p>

<p>The General was pacing up and down the hall.
He appeared to be in an excellent humor; his face
beamed with smiles and he rubbed his hands
together as if in expectation of some good fortune.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, Uncle Harold," said May,
quite bravely.</p>

<p>The General bent his head and went into the
library, followed by May, who was beginning to
feel apprehensive of the character of the interview.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sit down, my boy," said the General, graciously,
sitting down himself as he spoke.</p>

<p>May sat down; clasped her hands; tried to look
unconcerned and succeeded in looking both uncomfortable
and unhappy.</p>

<p>"I will not deny that you have been a great
disappointment to me, Gay. From the promise of
your babyhood I was led to believe that you would
be a gentleman."</p>

<p>The General's manner, as well as his words,
seemed to cast a reflection upon somebody, and May
was prompt to resent both.</p>

<p>"Father and mother are gentlemen," she said.
"That is, father is a gentleman, and it is not their
fault if I'm not one."</p>

<p>The General stared slightly. He was not prepared
for so spirited an answer, albeit it was rather
ludicrous.</p>

<p>"You are come of a family of gentlemen including,
of course, your father," the General said,
with the air of one who means to keep his temper,
no matter what happens. "But I can't retract my
statement regarding the disappointment you are to
me."</p>

<p>"I do not ask you to, sir," said May, very distinctly.</p>

<p>The General's face grew very red when this cool
response met his ears, but he controlled himself,
and said,—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have said that I perceive defects in your
deportment that are lamentable from my point of
view; it is my purpose to remedy them."</p>

<p>"How?" May inquired, simply.</p>

<p>"By a course of training," replied the General,
with a bland smile.</p>

<p>"Have you written to my father about
it?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the General, looking dazed.</p>

<p>"You'd better ask his permission, first."</p>

<p>"Ask his permission," echoed the General, with
rising color that boded ill for May. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't think my father sent me up here to be
trained; I think he thought I was invited to visit
here."</p>

<p>"You impudent young jackanapes! Do you
refuse to have your bad manners mended?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you don't like them, but if they need
mending I think my father ought to know it before
you begin."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, sir, for telling me what I
should do, but it is not necessary for a person of
your age to dictate to me."</p>

<p>"I did not mean to dictate to you," said May.
Then she raised her small brown head proudly and
flashed her hazel eyes upon the astonished General,
and said,—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>"But I couldn't let even you insult my father
and mother."</p>

<p>"Insult!" roared the General, springing to his
feet.</p>

<p>May rose and faced him. "Yes, sir, insult. You
said my manners were bad when you knew father
and mother taught me them."</p>

<p>"This is too much!" gasped the General.
"Leave the room, sir!"</p>

<p>May obeyed, but no sooner was the threshold
crossed than her courageous mien changed to one
of sadness, and she walked away with bent head
and eyes that would fill with tears in spite of every
effort to restrain them.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Sarah, coming upon
May suddenly and noticing her tears.</p>

<p>May hid her face in Sarah's spotless lawn apron
and cried quietly.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to cry—but I can't help it," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>"Cry if you want to; there's no law against it,"
Sarah said, with characteristic crispness of speech,
which somehow did not sound unsympathetic.</p>

<p>Sarah saw the General coming, but of course
May did not, for her head was still buried in
Sarah's apron, and it was a surprise when he cried
with terrible scorn,—</p>

<p>"You have been crying, sir!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have been crying," May admitted, from the
folds of the apron, "but I haven't told Miss Sarah
how disagreeable you were to me."</p>

<p>Sarah turned her head away to hide the smile
this ingenious defense provoked; the General saw
the smile and it irritated him.</p>

<p>"Unless you can apologize handsomely, sir,"
said he, with his grandest air, "you may spend the
rest of the day in your room."</p>

<p>May walked away in silence that was more
expressive than speech.</p>

<p>"He is the most stubborn boy in the world!"
said the General. "He deserved a week in the
guard-house."</p>

<p>"You don't understand him," said Sarah. "But
you'll find there'll be a tug of war unless you
change your tactics."</p>

<p>"His discipline shall begin from this hour," said
the General, sternly. "I will not be defied in my
own house. Sarah, you will send him nothing but
bread and water to-day."</p>

<p>"General," Sarah replied, coolly, "you govern
the guard-house but I manage the kitchen! I
shall send that boy just what we have to eat, and
I may make ice-cream for him, beside."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE TRAINING BEGINS</small></h2>


<p>It was very early, but May was in the garden.
The sun was just rising and the morning glories on
the back porch turned their purple and rose and
white cups to catch the welcome light. The sky
was full of rosy clouds; dew glittered on the waving
grass and dancing flowers, and the birds were
singing as they only sing at dawn.</p>

<p>"What a lovely world this is!" cried May aloud.
"If my uncle liked me I should be almost too happy
this morning."</p>

<p>"He doesn't dislike you, dear," said Sarah, who
had come up softly behind May and had thus overheard
her words. May grasped her kind friend by
the hand and said, earnestly,—</p>

<p>"I thought that I wouldn't apologize. I have
changed my mind, or the dark changed it for me.
I think it is perfectly wonderful, how the dark, so
still and black, will make you willing to do things
that you've said ever so many times in the daytime
that you wouldn't do! I am going to apologize
because I'm ashamed of myself. Not because he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>shut me up in my room—I hope he will understand
that. I got up early to get braced up for it by the
air, and the flowers and the morning."</p>

<p>Sarah understood the feeling that prompted
May's early rising; the hours just after dawn have
more of inspiration in them than a whole library of
books about right living and thinking.</p>

<p>"The General is in the library; why don't you
go now?" asked Sarah, brightly.</p>

<p>"I will; and I will be as full of good humor as
father and as gentle as mother."</p>

<p>This was undertaking a good deal, but May was
in earnest; and to be in earnest is to be armed
against almost any enemy.</p>

<p>Much to her own surprise Sarah bent and kissed
the mock boy. "Now scamper!" said she. "And
come and tell me how well you have kept your
word."</p>

<p>The General was reading. A hundred lines of
Greek before breakfast was his daily appetizer and he
had just completed fifty when May slid into the room.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Uncle Harold!" said she.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my young sir," said the General,
with a smile, for "the dark" had worked its marvels
with him as well as with May.</p>

<p>The smile settled it!—as a smile will often settle
trifling differences if it be allowed—May did not
wait for further advances, but sprang into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>General's arms and promptly kissed him! The
General was amazed, and showed it. He had never
been kissed by a child, and his sensations when
May's fresh, dewy lips were laid on his were bewildering
in their variety. He was embarrassed,
of course, for old bachelors are not used to kisses;
he was saddened, too, but he was not displeased,
and May knew it.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sense of the difference between his
life as it was, with its calm, but narrow routine of
pleasures, its moments of dulness unbrightened by
the companionship of wife and the warm lips and
clinging arms of children, and the life that might
have been his had he not allowed his youth to slip
past him, awoke in him a sting of disgust, of self-pity.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not offended," May said, timidly,
for the General's silence was oppressive. "We
always kiss mother and father good morning—and—I
thought you might like to be treated as well."</p>

<p>"I do like being 'treated as well,'" said the
General, heartily.</p>

<p>"I didn't come in for just that; I came to tell
you that I am sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.
I hope you will excuse me."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will."</p>

<p>"I remembered last night that mother once said
something about what people ought to do when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>they were guests in anybody's house. She said it
to Alice, not to me, but it was something like this:
'No matter how disagreeable people are when you
are visiting them you must always bear it and never
resent or mention it to anybody'—and I don't mean
to again."</p>

<p>This ingenuous statement amused the General
vastly. "That is excellent advice and worthy of
your good mother," said he.</p>

<p>"Mother's advice is always excellent," said May,
proudly. "When it is hard to take, the way she
says it—so calm and sweet—takes the sting out. I
don't think we need to learn much except what
mother tells us."</p>

<p>"Always think so, my boy," said the General,
brokenly.</p>

<p>"Your mother must have been like mine,"
hazarded May. "How much you must have loved
her!"</p>

<p>To speak of his beloved mother was to make
a short cut to the General's heart, and at that
moment May could have demanded and received
any boon of him.</p>

<p>"You were reading when I came in," said May,
after a brief pause. "I hope I am not interrupting
you."</p>

<p>"Not at all; I learned my lesson fifty years ago
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>and I have not forgotten it."</p>

<p>"What were you reading?" asked May, who
was a sad chatterbox when at ease.</p>

<p>"I was reading a classic—do you know what
that means?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; a classic is a book in a leather binding.
Alice studies in them, and I think there must be
something very sad inside for I've often seen her
crying over them."</p>

<p>"Classics are touching tales to youth. What
would you think, Gay, of a goddess who corrected
her children with a thunderbolt?"</p>

<p>"I should think that must have been worse than
nurse's slipper. What was the goddess' name?"</p>

<p>"Juno."</p>

<p>"Did Juno call her thunderbolt a 'persuader'?
That's what nurse called her slipper. Mother
wouldn't let nurse use it and nurse didn't like it
very well. She said it had been used on little Lord
Roslyn and I guess she really thought it was too
good to use on us because we haven't titles. But
mother didn't believe in a persuader, even if it had
persuaded a little English lord, and I'm sure we
didn't!"</p>

<p>"I should say not!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harold, I came near forgetting to
tell you that my training can begin any time you
like. I think father will be delighted if I go home
with all my defects remedied."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>"We will begin right after breakfast," said the
General, delighted with this acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Breakfast is ready, sir," said Phyllis at the
door.</p>

<p>"Phyllis," cried May in delight, "my uncle has
forgiven me, and we are friends—great friends,
aren't we, Uncle Harold?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy."</p>

<p>"Well," said Phyllis to herself, "it does beat the
Dutch how that boy twists round a body's heart!"</p>

<p>"I'm a little hungry, aren't you?" suggested
May, with a smile.</p>

<p>Extraordinary spell of a child's face—of its candid
smile! The General forgot his dignity, his
rigid ideas of deportment; he bent and kissed May's
brow, then he said, "Come, dear."</p>

<p>These were strange words for him to speak; he
had never said "dear" in his life except as he had
coupled it with mother, and he said it under his
breath.</p>

<p>May got down from the General's knees and took
his hand. "We will go this way to show Miss
Sarah that we are friends—I told her that I thought
you didn't like me."</p>

<p>As they went along, hand in hand, the General
felt awkward. It was the simplest thing in the
world to make an excuse for withdrawing his hand,
but like many simple things this was hard to do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>May's fingers clung to his, and they seemed to have
some mysterious connection with May's kiss; both
were seals of the new bond between them.</p>

<p>"Miss Sarah!" cried May at the dining-room
door, "look at us! You wouldn't think we were
the enemies of yesterday, would you? Well, we
are not. We are true friends, now—and the training
is going to begin right after breakfast."</p>

<p>The training had already begun on both sides.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>A SILVER-HAIRED LADY</small></h2>


<p>"The package will keep—though I'm dying to
know what is in it—but I must read this letter from
my darling G——May, if you will excuse me." And
May broke the seal of the dearly-loved brother's
letter and began to read before the General could
say a word.</p>

<p>It was a characteristic letter; as she read May
seemed to see the writer dancing around the room
like a will-o'-the-wisp, and speaking the written
words without waiting for answer or comment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Dear Brownie," the letter began, "It is very
Hard to be a girl. I try, but I forget and act just
like a boy. But noBody seems to know—isn't it
Queer? I hope you are getting along better, but it
is real easy to act like a Boy; all you have to
do is to Act Natcherul. I cut my foot chopping
wood. Margery, a very nice woman that lives
here made me a little wee peach dumpling and I
had all the saurse I wanted. I can have coffee
for breakfast if I want it—can you? Aunt
Beulah has little white curls and they bob up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>and down when she talks. I would like to pull one
to see if it would come off like nurse's braid. You
always think you've done something wrong when
Aunt Beulah looks at you—at least I do, but I've
been doing it ever since I came, doing wrong for a
girl, I mean, not for a boy, for I've only acted like
myself. John is a very nice man. He was in the
War. He is one of the nicest men I Have ever Met.
He has a scar on his cheek, a soldier did it for him
in the War. He has a splendid nephew Patsey and
I have seen him. His Muscle is immense. John
lets me feed the cows and to-morrow if I am well I
shall feed the pigs, but I may have the lockjaw.
People do that are wounded. There is a pond here.
I have not seen it, but my friend John says so.
There are lilies in it and a boy, they think, for he
never came up. I open my mouth often to see if
it will work, and I haven't the Lockjaw yet. Aunt
Celia gave me a photograph for you and one for
me. I mailed yours. She is a lovely woman, all
smiles and a soft voice. I liker best. She isn't so
Terryfying. I haven't seen a Boy, but there are
some here, for John says they come to hook the
pears. They are not vagrums, he says, only mischievus.
If I catch them they'll wish They Hadn't
Come. They can have all the pears they want if
they ask, but they are 'Pirates,' John says. Your
affectionate Gay."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh!" sighed May, "Brown's foot is cut with
an ax; he may have lockjaw."</p>

<p>"Who's Brown?"</p>

<p>"My twin bro—my twin, I mean. Uncle George
calls him Brown and me Brownie because we're
both brown, do you see?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," remarked the General, who couldn't
see at all.</p>

<p>"This," said May, undoing the package, "is
Aunt Celia's photograph. She gave it to me.
Brown says she's lovely—and so she is. She
doesn't look a bit 'terrifying,' does she?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," answered the General, who
really knew nothing about it, for May had monopolized
the photograph and he had not had as much
as a glance at it.</p>

<p>"She looks like a little fairy godmother, doesn't
she?" said May, passing the photograph to her
uncle.</p>

<p>The General put on his glasses and looked at
the photograph.</p>

<p>"What a resemblance!" he cried.</p>

<p>"To whom?" May asked, running to his side.</p>

<p>"To my mother."</p>

<p>"It is our Aunt Celia Linn who lives at Hazelnook
where Ga—where Brown is."</p>

<p>The General became reflective. "I think I met
Miss Celia Linn in my youth," he said, at length,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>"when she was a young girl, but I didn't notice
the resemblance then and I cannot recall her
face."</p>

<p>This was not strange; the General in his youth
had studiously avoided looking at young girls long
enough to impress their features upon his memory.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to have her on your desk?
She is so pretty and looks so much like your
mother," said May, thinking her suggestion would
please the General.</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy," said the General, bowing
to the photograph, as though it was Miss Celia
herself who had expressed a desire to occupy his
desk. May gave the photograph a good position
on the desk, and with a bird-like tip of her head
which should have revealed to the dull General that
his guest was of the gentler sex, she looked first at
the photograph, then at the portraits on the wall,
saying,—</p>

<p>"Isn't it nice to have an alive woman in the
room, Uncle Harold? All the portrait people are
dead, aren't they? They look so."</p>

<p>"Yes, all are dead."</p>

<p>"There ought to be a frame for it," said May,
with true feminine instinct. "A pretty silver
frame for such a pretty silver-haired lady. We
might put a little vase of flowers beside it—some
roses and mignonette."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>"Very appropriate, indeed," said the General, to
whom a rose by the name of hollyhock or petunia
would have smelled quite as sweet.</p>

<p>"I will get them now," cried May, rushing out
of the room.</p>

<p>The General, left alone, wrote a brief note to a
New York firm, ordering a silver frame of the handsomest
design (for "a silver-haired lady"), and he
fancied all the time that he was doing this to please
his supposed nephew, and perhaps he was.</p>

<p>"I've picked some roses, Miss Sarah," cried May
through the kitchen window, "for a bouquet to
put beside the loveliest lady. Her photograph is
on Uncle Harold's desk and he likes it ever so
much."</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Hazelnook. Wouldn't you like to see it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sarah, shortly.</p>

<p>"There!" said May on her return to the library,
"isn't that pretty?"</p>

<p>"Very," said the General, looking critically at
the flowers held up for his inspection. "Where
did you learn to put posies together so neatly?"</p>

<p>"I didn't learn," said May, blithely. "Such
things are natural to girls, didn't you know that?"</p>

<p>"So I supposed; but I didn't know boys shared
that faculty."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harold," cried the young culprit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>with a desperate attempt to change the subject,
"when does my training begin?"</p>

<p>"At once, my boy, at once!" replied the delighted
disciplinarian.</p>

<p>May began to feel sorry that she had mentioned
the training, surrounded as it was by mystery, but
it was too late to recall her words.</p>

<p>The General said, "Come," and they left the
house together.</p>

<p>No sooner had they gone when Sarah sought the
library.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the woman that has the
brass to send her photograph to him," her thoughts
ran. Despite the General's sixty-six years and his
distaste for feminine society Sarah was constantly
apprehensive lest he fall a victim to some wily
woman's charms. "I've had trouble enough with
him," she was wont to say, as though she had
helped him through love-affairs innumerable!</p>

<p>It was with anything but agreeable emotions,
therefore, that she took Miss Celia's photograph
between her thumb and finger, holding it as if she
expected something to rub off, and looked at it
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Um," said Sarah, when her inspection was over,
and she left the room without further comment.
A little later she added, "It's his mother over
again!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>"Where are we going, Uncle Harold?" May
asked, as they walked briskly through the grounds.</p>

<p>"To the stables."</p>

<p>"What is he going to do to me?" May thought,
ruefully.</p>

<p>When they reached the stable the General went
to a glass case which held—horrors to relate!—a
fine collection of fire-arms. Selecting two rifles, the
General, with an inviting smile, extended one towards
May. If there was anything that our little
heroine in the hero's guise was really afraid of it
was a rifle, or, indeed, arms of any kind, and her
involuntary shrinking did not escape the General's
eye.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take it?" he asked, with the
nearest approach to sharpness that he had displayed
since they had become "friends."</p>

<p>"I—don't want to," said May, huddling herself
in a small bunch against the side of the barn.</p>

<p>The General did not lose his temper; fortunately,
too, for had he done so May would have turned and
fled, but his voice was stern, as he said,—</p>

<p>"Take that rifle and do as I bid you!"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A PLAN THAT FAILED</small></h2>


<p>When the doctor was gone, after saying that
Gay would be all right in a day or two, Miss Celia
took her place at the bedside of the sufferer, prepared
to play the nurse; Miss Linn and Margery
returned to their household duties; John resumed
his wood-chopping and Peace spread her downy
wing once more over Rose Cottage.</p>

<p>During the rest of the day Gay spoke so gently,
looked so pensive and behaved so like an angel that
Miss Linn wondered how she could have dreamed
of calling her mock niece a hoyden.</p>

<p>"She is perfectly angelic," Miss Linn confided
to her sister. "I don't know how I ever thought
her otherwise."</p>

<p>"The dear lamb," said Margery, after seeing Gay
among the pillows successfully playing the rôle of
angel, "she's no more like the tomboy as was flying
around the back-yard this forenoon than nothing in
the world. It looks," added Margery, who had had
what she called "an expe'runce" and was qualified
to judge, "it looks like a real change of heart."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Celia said nothing at first, but as day waned
into night and Gay did not relapse into his former
graceless conduct she added her meed of praise.</p>

<p>The next morning Gay was better—and Gay on
a couch of pain and Gay in health were two different
persons. Long before anybody else was astir
he was standing and stepping—gingerly at first,
then boldly—on the injured foot "to see if it would
hurt!" As it did not he began to dress, selecting,
with the recklessness of a boy, the first frock that
came to hand; one of May's best ones, a pretty
brown China silk, with smocked yoke, puffed-sleeves
and a quaint little chatelaine pocket. It was not
an easy frock to get into, and Gay tugged and
toiled, thinking regretfully of knickerbockers and
cambric blouse-waist.</p>

<p>"Goodness," he panted, "I wonder who would
be a girl if it could be helped."</p>

<p>The chatelaine pocket belonged on the side, but
in Gay's hands it swung in front.</p>

<p>"It will be handy for pears and things," said
Gay to himself.</p>

<p>The hooks and eyes on the bodice showed the
utmost aversion for one another, refusing to meet
until forced to, but at length they were as securely
joined as man and wife, and Gay popped his head
out of the window to cool his brow. Making a
girl's toilet was serious and heating work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good morning, little invalid!" cried a pleasant
voice. It was Miss Celia standing in the trim
garden below.</p>

<p>Then Gay, obeying one of those extraordinary
impulses that govern boys when there is a chance
to court disaster, climbed through the window,
swung off, caught a sturdy trumpet vine and slid
to the ground, scattering leaves and flowers before
him as he went. Rose Cottage was a low, irregular
building and the distance from the window to the
ground was not great, but such a descent was not
without danger, and it certainly was one which
the average wearer of petticoats would not have essayed.
Poor, frightened Miss Celia permitted Gay
to upset her ideas of maidenly propriety without a
word of censure; she had scarcely strength to say,—</p>

<p>"May, how could you do that?"</p>

<p>"I had to, auntie; I felt so full! After I have
stayed in the house a whole day I have to do something
to let off steam. Don't you?"</p>

<p>Miss Celia disclaimed all acquaintance with this
mental condition, but she didn't scold a bit, and
Gay, realizing that he was not playing his part with
great skill, appreciated her forbearance.</p>

<p>"What did they know about girls?" Miss Celia
silently argued. "Two old maids whose youth was
passed? The ways of modern childhood were a
sealed book to them."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>Not so lenient were Miss Linn's judgments. She,
also, had seen Gay's descent, and having recovered
from her fright she began to be indignant; to
think that it was time something; was done to curb
such high animal spirits. It might be her guest's
taste to leave the house by a second story window;
it was not hers!</p>

<p>So after breakfast she demanded Gay's presence
in the morning room.</p>

<p>"Did you bring any work with you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What kind of work do you mean?" said Gay,
looking puzzled.</p>

<p>"Sewing."</p>

<p>"Sewing! I can't sew."</p>

<p>"Can't sew!" cried Miss Linn, in horror.
"Have you never learned?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said Gay, thinking this would end the
matter.</p>

<p>This was a mistake. Miss Linn immediately
produced, from the depths of a work-basket, a
number of small squares of bright-colored calico
and white cotton cloth, and spread them on a table.</p>

<p>"Is that a game?" asked Gay, curiously.</p>

<p>"It is patchwork," Miss Linn replied, amazed at
such ignorance.</p>

<p>"What is it for?" questioned Gay, who had no
acquaintance with those monuments to feminine
industry, known as quilts and "comforters."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>"For you to make a pretty little quilt for your
bed," said Miss Linn, in a persuasive tone.
"Wouldn't you like to have it?"</p>

<p>"No, I thank you. A blanket is good enough
for me!" said naughty Gay.</p>

<p>"But this would be your own work!" said Miss
Linn, trying to arouse the housewifely instinct in
the fraud's breast. "See, it would look so." And
Miss Linn arranged the squares of calico in the
right relations with the squares of cloth.</p>

<p>"Yes—like a checker-board," said Gay, not very
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is very nice?" said Miss Linn.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be half bad for camping; and it
might do for a sail if a fellow was hard up, though
I guess the wind would rip it to smithereens in a
little while."</p>

<p>Miss Linn was in despair. Was there ever such
a girl? Or one who used such peculiar expressions?
The poor lady was not quite certain that
she was listening to slang, but she had a suspicion
that she was. "Rip" and "Smithereens" sounded
like it.</p>

<p>"The doctor's wife is on the porch, mem,"
announced Margery at the door.</p>

<p>"Say that I will be right out," said Miss Linn.</p>

<p>"Good," thought Gay. "I shall get out of this
mess!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;"><a id="i_086fp"></a>

<div class="caption">GAY DROVE THE NEEDLE INTO HIS THUMB</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>But his exultation was premature!</p>

<p>"May," said Miss Linn, "here are squares
already sewed. I want you to put the other pieces
together in the same way. Yes, you can do it,"
she added, for she saw signs of rebellion in Gay's
face. "Here are needles, thread and a thimble
that Aunt Celia used when she was a little girl. You
must do it somehow," and Miss Linn left the room.</p>

<p>"Sew!" muttered Gay, distracted at this fresh
calamity. "I won't do it; I'll tell her that I'm a
boy and be sent home!" And disturb the mother
whose recovery to health depended upon freedom
from agitation? No; that would not do. There
was nothing to do but submit to this indignity, and
Gay picked up a square, pondered a moment as if
trying to recall some knowledge of the art of sewing,
grasped the threaded needle and drove it
through the cloth into his thumb!</p>

<p>"Christopher Columbus!" cried Gay. "I'd
rather take a flogging than try to manage this old
needle!"</p>

<p>Then he began again; by pushing the needle
half way through one side of the square, then
turning the square over and pulling the needle and
thread through on that side, several uneven stitches
were taken, but a knot put an end to this. Gay
pulled and jerked the thread until it broke, then
a new dilemma presented itself; the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>thread slipped through the cloth in spite of his
efforts to keep it where it belonged.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright idea struck him. "I hope
there's some here," he said, to himself. There was
"some" in a crystal jar, on Miss Celia's davenport,
and Gay went manfully to work to join the squares
together with mucilage. This was his bright idea!
In order to facilitate matters he used his lap for a
table.</p>

<p>In a little while he dashed out on the porch
where his aunts were entertaining their caller.
"Here it is, all done!" he cried.</p>

<p>Miss Linn's astonished gaze traveled from the
silk frock where the mucilage was trickling down
the front breadths in little streams, to the patchwork
with the wet rim round each square. "I told
you to sew it," she said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Gay, with exasperating politeness,
"you said get it together somehow—and
isn't gluing it, 'somehow'?"</p>

<p>"May," said Miss Linn, flushing with mortification,
"go to your room and stay until I come."</p>

<p>Gay turned away, muttering something not intended
for anybody's ears, but Miss Linn heard it.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I said that if I had known that visiting was
like going to a reform school I wouldn't have
come," replied Gay, the incorrigible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE BOY PREDOMINATES</small></h2>


<p>After Gay had sulked a little in his room, and
indulged in rather violent criticism of Miss Linn,
the aspect of matters changed somewhat. What
was the use of spending the rest of the day in the
dumps? There must be some fun to be had even
in the quiet guest-room. It occurred to him that it
would be sport to lean out of the window as far as
possible and try to look in the dining-room window,
which was just below, with his head upside down.</p>

<p>This was dangerous, of course, for a fall would
have shaken up the performer a trifle, but the
danger was the fun and Gay hung out till his head
nearly touched the window below. While he was
enjoying himself in this way Margery passed through
the garden and saw him.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious," she cried. "You mustn't
do that, Miss May."</p>

<p>"Why mustn't I?" asked Gay, not moving at all.</p>

<p>"You'll break your neck," answered Margery.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I shan't," replied Gay, a good deal
flattered by this interest. "I could lean out still
farther."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>"May!" shrieked Margery, covering her head
with her apron.</p>

<p>"Don't you like it?"</p>

<p>"Mercy, no. Are ye in yet?" said Margery,
without uncovering her head.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm in."</p>

<p>Margery uncovered her face and looked first on
the ground to see if Gay was there in fragments, then
up at the window where he was now sitting astride
of the window-sill, swinging one foot on the outside.</p>

<p>"Oh!" shrieked Margery, when she saw this
dreadful position. "Do get in, miss; you'll get
dizzy and fall out."</p>

<p>"I'm not allowed to do anything in this house!"
sulked Gay. A moment later he added, "Shall I
have my dinner up here?"</p>

<p>"I guess so."</p>

<p>"Well, if you will give me some stout string and
that little tray in the kitchen with open work places
on the ends, I'll rig something to hoist my dinner
up from the dining-room and let down the dishes
afterwards. It will save you lots of bother."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," said Margery discreetly,
hurrying away.</p>

<p>Gay sat quietly on the window for a moment,
looking out over the garden to the street beyond in
search of something diverting. A boy, carrying a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>large tin pail, was passing, and Gay recognized
him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Patsey!" he shouted. "Come into the
yard, won't you?"</p>

<p>Patsey saw Gay at once and answered,—</p>

<p>"I can't now, miss; I'm carryin' ther dinner ter
me mother's boarders."</p>

<p>"All right," returned Gay, who wouldn't have
been guilty of interfering with business. "Stop
when you come back, then."</p>

<p>"I will, miss," Patsey replied, with a grin of
delight. The democratic manner of the visitor at
Rose Cottage was quite to Patsey's mind; he appreciated
the good fellowship with which "Miss May"
treated him.</p>

<p>"She's a darlin'," he thought, admiringly.
"She's me notion of a lady—speakin' to a b'y as if
he was a human bein'."</p>

<p>Patsey's "notion of a lady" was a fairly good
one, albeit he was somewhat deceived in the specimen
of which he spoke.</p>

<p>When Patsey was out of sight Gay remembered,
with a pang of regret, that he had an engagement
with John at the noon hour. "I will write a note
to Aunt Beulah," thought he.</p>

<p>There were pen, ink and paper in the room, and
after various trials Gay wrote this note:—</p>

<p>"I write to ask you to Comute my Sentence. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>have an Important ingagement at twelve. I'll go
back to prison when I've kept it, if you will let me
come down."</p>

<p>Gay did not know how to spell "commute" nor
did he understand the precise meaning of his first
sentence, but he had heard his father, who was a
lawyer, use it in connection with prisoners, and he
thought it calculated to impress his aunts. He
lowered the note by a string and bobbed it up and
down in front of the dining-room window until
Margery saw it and took it in.</p>

<p>"For Aunt Beulah, with my compliments," said
Gay, with great courtesy.</p>

<p>A moment after Margery thrust her head out of
the lower window. "You can come down," she said.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Gay, dashing out of the
room, jumping down three stairs at one jump and
completing the descent by sliding down the bannisters.</p>

<p>There was quite a group on the porch—the
doctor's wife, who had been "persuaded" to spend
the day; the minister, who was willing to be persuaded,
so agreeable did he find Miss Celia's companionship,
and the doctor—who was not the
doctor's wife's husband, by the way. They were
all laughing when Gay appeared.</p>

<p>"Your engagement must be very important, Miss
May," said the doctor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is," said Gay brightly, for he liked the big,
bluff, jolly doctor, "I'm going to feed the pigs for
John."</p>

<p>This simple assertion was not received with favor
by the feminine portion of the group, but the
doctor laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"I think pigs very interesting animals; so contented
and fat and jolly—Jane says contentment is
better than wealth," Gay said.</p>

<p>"I have been told so," remarked the doctor,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I mean to be a farmer when I grow up," continued
unwary Gay. "I used to think I'd be a
lawyer, like father, but I've changed my mind."</p>

<p>"A lawyer!" Miss Linn exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I have heard," observed the minister, "that
one of the results of the popular movement for the
higher education of women is to cause even baby
girls to select professions."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" sighed the doctor's wife, who
was reared in the good old time when music,
manners and morals were the only accomplishments
in which girls were instructed.</p>

<p>"Are you in favor of suffrage?" asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Suffrage!" repeated Gay, for the word was not
a familiar one.</p>

<p>"You will vote, won't you?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," said Gay, on safe ground now, "when
I'm twenty-one."</p>

<p>"How terrible!" gasped poor Miss Linn.
"What is the world coming to? The ballot and a
profession! And to think such heresy is alive in
Elinor Walcott's household!"</p>

<p>"But you will go to balls and parties when you
grow up, won't you?" asked the doctor's wife,
hoping this remark would elicit a fitting reply.</p>

<p>"Not much!" said Gay, scornfully. "My
father says we want fewer leaders of the cotillon
and more leaders of opinion in this country. I
mean to make mother proud of me."</p>

<p>"I think you'll do it, little girl," said the doctor.
"Your parents have exemplified in your training
the advice of the eminent divine—'make all your
sons virtuous and all your daughters brave.'"</p>

<p>The minister opened his mouth to reply, but as
the first word trembled on his lips, Gay gave a
whoop, cleared the stoop with one bound and ran
toward the pear orchard.</p>

<p>"What is it now?" said Miss Linn, plaintively.</p>

<p>The company rose with one accord and sought
the lawn, where they had a view of Gay, then in
the midst of a group of boys, dealing blows right
and left.</p>

<p>"Is she fighting?" groaned Miss Linn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, she will be hurt!" cried Miss Celia.
"May, my dear child, come here."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" gasped the doctor's
wife.</p>

<p>"Let her alone; she's a scientific boxer," the
doctor cried, after a hasty glance.</p>

<p>"A scientific boxer!" cried Miss Linn, clinging
to Celia's arm for support. "Elinor's daughter
that!"</p>

<p>"I dare say it's so," said the doctor's wife. "I
have heard that the best families in New York are
making athletes of their girls."</p>

<p>"Very sensibly, too," replied the doctor.
"There goes the Carver boy end over end."</p>

<p>"Somebody must separate them! What are we
thinking of!" said Miss Celia.</p>

<p>"Shall I go?" asked the minister, who secretly
thought the young Arab could take care of herself,
but who was anxious to do Miss Celia's bidding.</p>

<p>"There goes the last boy over the fence," said
the doctor. "Bravo! Miss May," he added, as
Gay, in tattered frock, joined them, "victory all
along the line, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I could have downed a dozen like them,"
gasped the victor. "They were hardly worth tackling;
they know about as much about boxing as
hens, but I guess they'll let the pears alone for
a while."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>"A girl," began Miss Linn, in awful tones, "a
girl of refinement would not fight with a vulgar
rabble of boys; she would not notice them."</p>

<p>"Do I look like a girl of refinement?" asked
Gay, with an audacious smile.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>GAY'S POPULARITY BEGINS</small></h2>


<p>When Gay's challenge, "Do I look like a girl of
refinement?" was flung back at Miss Linn, following
as it did one of the most extraordinary scenes
of which a girl was ever the heroine, it was indeed
marvelous that it did not reveal him in his true
colors. But everybody seemed to be blind, unreasoning,
stupid. It was a mystery that the prowess
of the valiant disposer of the boyish robbers was
not speedily traced to its real origin, that of sex.
Gay's conversation, liberally interspersed as it was
with slang, was enough in itself to proclaim him a
lively, wide-awake boy. Speech, actions, and bearing
all pointed in one direction, but Gay's audience
permitted their vision to be obscured by—petticoats.</p>

<p>It was not strange that the gentle, unworldly occupants
of Rose Cottage were, at first, misled.
They had invited a girl; and a girl, as far as outward
garb could make one, had arrived. At Cedarville
a similar misconception had occurred. With
a single exception no one dreamed that the twins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>had exchanged roles and clothes. Miss Maud
Berkeley, alone, regarded Gay with suspicion.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, after exchanging clothes each
acted his or her part with freedom from disguise
that made their success the more marked. Gay and
May had ceased to regard their position as enviable;
it was no longer a "lark" to masquerade in each
other's clothes, but trained from infancy to self-reliance
and self-restraint, they were capable of much
endurance, even in a mistaken cause. Already they
were looking forward to their release; the delicate
girl not more eagerly than the strong boy.</p>

<p>After Gay's reply to his aunt, a council of war,
at which he was not present, was held in the drawing-room
at Rose Cottage. The minister confined
his efforts to indorsing Miss Celia's sentiments, notwithstanding
the fact that that lady, whose heart
was with the culprit, but whose judgment was with
the council, contradicted herself constantly. It was
the doctor's wife who suggested surrounding Gay
with girls as a means of conventionalizing him!</p>

<p>"Invite girls of her own age here; it is the only
thing that will do any good," said she positively.</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Miss Linn. "I will give a
party at once to introduce May to the girls here."</p>

<p>Then, with the minuteness of detail that characterizes
the discussions of persons who lead uneventful
lives, these good people planned the festivity that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>was formally to introduce the young rogue to the
Hazelnook girls.</p>

<p>The next event of the day following the skirmish
under the pear tree was Gay's receipt of a letter
from his father. It was written, of course, to the
real May, and while reading it, the mock May experienced
a sharp twinge of conscience. It was so
unconsciously condemnatory in its entire confidence
that it made Gay really unhappy—for a moment.</p>

<p>The letter was brief.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear little Daughter</span>,—</p>

<p>"Three days have passed since you left us, and I
am glad to be able to tell you that your mother is
better—a few days more and her poor nerves will
have begun to strengthen, then for a holiday for us
all somewhere in the lovely country. Ned is a good
boy, and nurse is very proud of Baby, who grows
to look, so she says, more and more like the sixth
Earl of Roslyn. What a comical, pink, squirming
little earl he must have been, mustn't he? Alice
is enjoying herself very much; she has won a prize
in a tennis tournament at Lake Hopatcong, and has
been to three parties. You can see what you have
to look forward to when you are a young lady of
fifteen! Your dear mother sends love and kisses,
and says, 'Tell my little girl to be gentle and
good.' And I add, try to do as your aunts wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>in everything; even though their way may differ
from your mother's way. Different people, different
ways, you know, dear. With love to our little girl,
and compliments to the aunties, I am,</p>

<p>"Your loving father,</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Edward Walcott</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"New York, Aug. 10, 1900."</p></div>

<p>"It doesn't seem right for father to think he
is writing to one when he's writing to the other!"
thought Gay. "Still, we're really the same as one,
and now that mother is better we can soon tell and
then it will be all right. I'm tired of it and I'm
ashamed to have father and mother and everybody
trusting me when I'm a fraud, besides, I'm tearing
May's clothes all to pieces and I shall have to tell
pretty soon, or go to bed."</p>

<p>The letter had a good effect, however, for Gay
really tried to be "gentle and good." He behaved
with such propriety that the poor deluded aunts
were in raptures.</p>

<p>"She can be charming when she likes," Miss
Linn said.</p>

<p>"I don't condemn her conduct yesterday; it was
incomprehensible, but what a brave little thing she
is! I'm sure the doctor admires her," Miss Celia
said proudly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>"The minister doesn't admire her," Miss Linn
said significantly.</p>

<p>Miss Celia's face flushed a delicate rose. "That
does not interest me," she said.</p>

<p>"Why, Celia!" exclaimed her sister.</p>

<p>And Miss Celia, for some mysterious reason,
looked confused.</p>

<p>After dinner Gay wrote a letter to May and
asked permission to post it, which was granted. A
small group of boys, among whom were the robbers,
stood in front of the post-office. They were talking
earnestly.</p>

<p>"There wasn't any science about it. What are
you giving us?" one was saying.</p>

<p>"Here she is now," another boy cried, as he
saw Gay.</p>

<p>"Nice girl! Nice girlie to fight with boys!" a
third boy said.</p>

<p>"You don't want any more, do you?" said Gay,
forgetting his feminine apparel and his resolution
to be "gentle and good."</p>

<p>A saucy fellow came up to Gay with a gibe on
his tongue and made a move as if to disarrange
Gay's frock, when down in the dust he went on his
face.</p>

<p>"If you can be civil we'll call it square; if you
can't I'll show you how to be," said Gay, calmly.</p>

<p>"We'll call it square," said the first speaker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>with a smile that was pleasant despite its width.
"You're made of the real stuff, if you are a girl."</p>

<p>"Much obliged for your good opinion," replied
Gay with an answering smile.</p>

<p>"I'll get even with you!" said the boy who had
been tripped up.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Gay, coolly.</p>

<p>"You talk big because you're a girl and you
think I daren't touch you!" growled the boy.</p>

<p>"I didn't stop to talk big yesterday, did I?"
asked Gay, with rising color.</p>

<p>"No, you didn't; you hit like a good one. I'll
take it all back about big talk," said the boy,
heartily.</p>

<p>"Let's shake hands on that," said Gay, forgetting
that girls do not commonly display so much
cordiality toward comparative strangers, it being a
boy's privilege to be "hail fellow well met" with all.</p>

<p>After a general handshaking, which was accompanied
by some embarrassment on the part of the
boys, who were unaccustomed to the society of girls
and did not know that their new acquaintance was
a very poor imitation of one, they told Gay their
names and such portions of their history as seemed
to fit the occasion.</p>

<p>"You'd better call me Brown Walcott," said
Gay. "That's what the fellows in New York call
me—my twin sister is called Brownie."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>The boys looked at one another sheepishly; they
didn't know what to say.</p>

<p>"Well, we will call you Miss—Brown," faltered
Lyman Carver at length.</p>

<p>"Drop the Miss," said Gay.</p>

<p>"All right, we will. We can drop her easier
than we can beat her in any other way!" said Will
Babbitt.</p>

<p>This speech which everybody applauded—save
Gay, who refrained through a delicate sense of
modesty—immediately established a feeling of good
fellowship.</p>

<p>"I promised to come right back," said Gay.
"Walk along with me, won't you? It seems
mighty good to see some fellows once more."</p>

<p>The boys stared. This was the most extraordinary
girl! There was no resisting her pleasant
manner, however, and they were soon walking along
together, all talking merrily.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Gay, suddenly, when they were outside
the gate at Rose Cottage, "I'm going to have
some kind of a time to-morrow afternoon at five
o'clock; my aunt said so to-day. I wish you'd come."</p>

<p>This was another embarrassing moment! The
boys were not generally included among aristocratic
Miss Linn's young guests.</p>

<p>"I don't believe we should know anybody there
except by sight," said Robert Clark at length.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>"It will be a good chance to get acquainted with
everybody, then," Gay replied.</p>

<p>"I don't think we can go, anyway, because we've
got a game to-morrow afternoon," said Lyman.</p>

<p>"Ball?" questioned Gay.</p>

<p>"Yes," Lyman answered.</p>

<p>"Put it off till day after to-morrow and I'll come,"
said Gay.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about ball?" asked
Fred Brown, wondering secretly if there was anything
that this wonderful girl wasn't up to.</p>

<p>"If you can get on to my curves I'll give you
the dandiest bat you ever held in your hands," Gay
said, with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The boys were literally overcome by this challenge,
but Lyman succeeded in saying,</p>

<p>"We'll take you up on that some day, Brown."</p>

<p>"It can't be too soon to suit me," laughed Gay.
Then he threw one arm across Lyman's shoulders,
the other across Will's and added, persuasively,
"Promise you will come to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You see," said Will, "we don't belong to that
set and when they meet us at church affairs they
generally treat us as if we were heathen. They are
not like you, Brown."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see anybody treat my guests that
way!" said Gay, defiantly. "If you come I guess
you'll see that my party isn't a church show."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>When Gay went into the house the minister was
there; his nearest approach to a week-day occupation
was visiting Miss Celia. "Who were those
boys, Miss May?" he asked, with a desire to be
agreeable.</p>

<p>"Hazelnook boys; splendid fellows. Don't you
know them?"</p>

<p>"I think not, though their parents may be my
parishioners. All boys of that age look alike."</p>

<p>"Aunt Celia," said Gay that evening, when they
were alone, "I don't think much of that minister."</p>

<p>"Why not, dear?" Miss Celia asked with considerable
interest.</p>

<p>"Because ministers say they want to be like
Jesus, but He wouldn't have said about the boys,
'They all look alike,' just as if He didn't care
how they looked and didn't want to know them!
I'm sure He knew all the boys wherever He went."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear, for making something clear to
me," Miss Celia said, softly.</p>

<p>And Gay wondered in vain what Miss Celia
meant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>A SQUAD OF ONE</small></h2>


<p>"It is necessary that we understand one another
before we begin," said the General. "Do you
know what the position of the soldier is?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much about it," May answered,
"but it must be an awfully hard one—having to
carry a gun, and go into battle and kill other
soldiers and stay out doors all night in the dark,
and not see his family and—oh, it must be a very
hard position!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean precisely that," the General said,
"I meant this." And he assumed the soldier's position,
arms at a carry. "Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said May. "It makes me think of a
dog when you say 'Head up, sir, and tail erect.'"</p>

<p>"I should not have described it in just those
terms, but perhaps you have caught the idea," said
the General, whose sense of humor, as it may have
been observed, was not abnormally developed.
"Take the position yourself."</p>

<p>May laid the rifle on the barn floor, preparatory
to obeying.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>"Keep your piece," the General commanded.</p>

<p>"Piece—of what?" asked May, looking puzzled.
"I haven't a piece of anything."</p>

<p>"Piece, arm, rifle and musket are synonymous
terms," explained the General. "Do you know
what synonymous means?"</p>

<p>"One just as bad as the other," May promptly
replied.</p>

<p>The General smiled, but he was not to be diverted
from his purpose by absurd replies.</p>

<p>"You may leave your piece where it is for the
present," said he, "and you are to do as I bid
you. Stand where you are. Now, heels well together,
feet out—yes, that is good—body erect,
chest out—that is excel——"</p>

<p>"Oh, I go to a gymnasium!" interrupted May,
"and I know one mustn't mistake one's stomach
for one's chest, for they are not the same, whatever
some people may think."</p>

<p>This knowledge of one of the primary lessons in
physical culture impressed the General very favorably.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he. "I shall make a soldier of
you yet. I shall have you at West Point before
you know it, my boy!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to get me there that way if you get
me there at all!" said May, with a wry face, which
the General did not see. "I'll never go there if I
do know it," she added, under her breath.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>"Shoulders square," resumed the General.
"Arms at the side, elbows near the body—no,
not——"</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to dig my elbows into my
ribs?" asked May. "They stay better that way."</p>

<p>"No, there must be no stiffness or constraint in
these positions," the General said.</p>

<p>"I don't see what else you can get in them,"
May said. "I feel as if there was a stick running
right down my back, and I'm sure I shall never be
able to move my feet again."</p>

<p>"Yet I think I understood you to say you go to
the gymnasium," said the General.</p>

<p>"Yes, but the gymnasium is no more like this
than—than a Christmas party is like a Sunday-school,"
May replied.</p>

<p>"Attention!" commanded the General.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," May responded, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You need not reply; the soldier says nothing;
he obeys," said the General.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose the officers do all the talking,"
said May, in direct defiance of the General's last
remark. "But can't the soldier answer back at
all?"</p>

<p>"No, not during drill," said the General.</p>

<p>"They must make it up when they're not drilling!"
said May.</p>

<p>"Attention!" the General shouted. "Palms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>the hands front, little fingers behind the seam of
the trousers, chin drawn in, eyes front—eyes front,
I say."</p>

<p>"Dear me, Uncle Harold, how can I keep my
eyes front and see how my hands and fingers and
feet are at the same time?" grumbled May.</p>

<p>"By practise; we will try it again," said the
General.</p>

<p>And try it again they did, without, and then with
arms, until May was ready to drop with fatigue.
She was a plucky little recruit, but the Springfield
Cadet rifle; weight over eight pounds, with bayonet
nearly nine pounds, was not exactly a plaything.
At length the General saw that she was
tired and commanded,</p>

<p>"Squad, rest!"</p>

<p>May knew what rest meant and sat down on the
stable floor without ceremony.</p>

<p>"Am I a squad?" she inquired. "What does
it mean?"</p>

<p>"A squad is a number of armed men," the General
replied. "The term slipped out before I was
aware of it—I have never drilled a single recruit."</p>

<p>While they were at a rest the General deemed it
wise to continue her instructions by defining various
terms, such as columns, rank, file, front, rear, etc.,
and then he said,—</p>

<p>"There are three kinds of commands——"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>"I think I know what they are," said May
quickly.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the General.</p>

<p>"The command that you obey, the kind you don't
obey and the kind you half obey," said May.</p>

<p>The General laughed heartily at this. The recruit
certainly had very droll ideas of tactics, but
the instructor saw fit to enlighten him more precisely
as to the meaning of military commands.
After explaining more motions than May could
have mastered in a month, the General cried,—</p>

<p>"Attention!"</p>

<p>"I'm looking," said May.</p>

<p>"Fall in," commanded the General.</p>

<p>"What shall I fall into?" demanded May, not
offering to rise.</p>

<p>"Gay!" the General cried, dropping the military
formality of a drill master and speaking as an
annoyed relative, "I explained that to you only a
moment ago! What do you think it means?"</p>

<p>"That you want me to get up, I suppose," May
replied, rising and assuming the soldier's position,
with a smothered sigh.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you put it in better form than that?"
asked the General, patiently but reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said May, rather listlessly.
"You were just telling me about 'fatigue' things—my
answer was a 'fatigue' answer!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p>But although the General laughed, thinking
May vastly diverting, he ignored her hint and
began to instruct her in the mysteries of Present
arms, Right shoulder arms, Order arms, Parade
rest—and nobody knows what else, looking at the
execution of her movements with the enthusiasm of
a veteran. He seemed to be animated with the
spirit of a dozen generals, and roared and thundered
his commands as though he had been drilling
a large squad instead of one weary little girl in
borrowed uniform. They had just gone through
for the sixth time, Left, reverse—an exceedingly
tiresome position as all cadets know—when, without
a word of warning to the General, May slipped to
the ground and lay there in a motionless heap.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What is it?" cried the
General. "Can't you speak, my boy?"</p>

<p>May did not reply, and the General, now thoroughly
alarmed, picked her up and bore her in his
arms to Sarah.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing to him?" Sarah
demanded, as she took May in her arms.</p>

<p>"I've been instructing him——" began the General.</p>

<p>"You'd better instruct yourself!" Sarah interrupted,
indignantly. "Drilling this poor boy till
he faints! Phyllis, the smelling salts, and some
water."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>When May recovered from her swoon the General
asked,—</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you were tired?"</p>

<p>"You said the good soldier obeyed without
speaking," May said, with a wan smile. "I was
trying to learn how."</p>

<p>"Bless my heart, what a boy you are!" the
General exclaimed, actually kissing the "boy's"
cheek. "This shall not happen again; you shall
have a fine light rifle for your own as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, but I really don't care for
one!" said May, secretly alarmed at the thought
of having to harbor such a dangerous possession.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else that you can think of
that you would like to have?" questioned the
General, anxiously, for he wanted to make amends
for his late thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried May. "If I could have one
of those big dolls with a phonograph inside—almost
a human inside, talk and a laugh all there, I should
be perfectly happy!"</p>

<p>"A doll!" said the General, with a frown.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know a girl that would like it!" May
said quickly, fearing that she had betrayed herself.</p>

<p>"A rifle will be a more appropriate gift," replied
the General.</p>

<p>He gave May some silver, however, that burned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>so in her pocket that as soon as she could she went
to the village to spend it. She bought a doll's hat,
one admirably suited to Maud Madeleine's waxen
features, and on leaving the store she encountered
Philip Guy Brentwood. He was not alone; two
boys, whether of the same species or not May could
not determine, were with him.</p>

<p>"I saw you buying a doll's bonnet," said Philip,
disagreeably. "What a sissy! Bah, you make me
tired!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you weren't born so?" May
asked, good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"I'll have that hat to pay you for insulting
me!" cried Philip.</p>

<p>He made a dash for the hat; May thrust out her
foot suddenly and Philip measured his length in
the dust.</p>

<p>The boys shouted for more, but May, who was
"no fighter," walked quickly away.</p>

<p>"I'll be even with you, yet," Philip muttered
angrily.</p>

<p>But it might have been observed that he made
no effort to overtake May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>CONCERNING PHILIP</small></h2>


<p>May sat on a pile of hay in the lower barn,
trimming the doll's hat she had bought in the
village, singing as she worked. Three days had
passed since she made the purchase and this was the
first opportunity to add a beautiful feather found
in the barn yard and a bow of ribbon to Maud
Madeleine's new head gear. She had drilled every
morning with greater success than had attended
her maiden effort, thanks to the General's increased
solicitude and a little device of her own which
enabled her to handle her rifle without fear of instant
death.</p>

<p>With feminine strategy she had induced James
to take her rifle apart, then telling him that she
would put it together she filled the breech and the
barrel with cotton wool and threw the cartridge
under the barn! As the piece was a safety notch,
the subsequent military movements were executed
with a light heart; the General's command to "fall
in" was received with as light a heart as an invitation
to "take a chair."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>But a problem to the full as interesting as
present arms was absorbing May's thoughts as she
sewed: Philip, and how to square accounts with
him.</p>

<p>Philip now made daily visits to the Haines'
mansion, and it often seemed to May that he came
solely to bully and tease her. Philip thought the
girl in knickerbockers a very timorous lad; he,
therefore, put forth all his talent for jeering and
sneering, with unhappy result.</p>

<p>"He's spoiling for a fight," May said to herself,
with unerring accuracy. "But I should be ashamed
to come to blows with a boy, although I know he's
so much of a coward that he would be more scared
than I if we did have a little set-to. I wonder
what Gay would do? But I know; he'd take some
of Philip's swagger out of him. Still, I'm not Gay,
if I am wearing his clothes."</p>

<p>Now, as it may be seen, May was not an Amazon
nor a miniature virago. She knew a little about
boxing; she had been a pupil of Uncle George,
who had been a student at Harvard College, where
he had learned a great deal about sports, and it is
probable that had she overcome her dislike to fighting
she would have taught Philip a wholesome lesson.
She was to teach him one in another and a better
way, but she did not know it, and as she sewed she
wrestled with her problem and could not solve it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>While May sat there on the fragrant hay, the
afternoon sunshine streaming in upon her, Philip
made his appearance, and so unexpectedly that she
had not time to whisk the hat out of sight.</p>

<p>"Are you sewing?" cried Philip, with a loud
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," May answered, with a deep blush.</p>

<p>"What an awful sissy you are, anyway! You
kiss people; you don't dare to fight, and you sew!
You ought to go into a dime museum!"</p>

<p>"You forgot to mention one other thing."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I don't dare to be as rude and disagreeable as
a savage."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that; you're a freak without
it!"</p>

<p>May laughed; Philip's answer was rather bright
and she showed her appreciation of it.</p>

<p>"You got one on me that time, Philip."</p>

<p>"Where did you learn to sew?" asked Philip,
who wanted more fun on this subject.</p>

<p>"At a kindergarten—you didn't think I was
born clever enough to sew, did you?" said May,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I once knew another boy that sewed. He died,
and he deserved to!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may have been just the sewing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>made him good enough to die," May said, laughingly,
determined not to lose her temper or show
Philip that he annoyed her.</p>

<p>"I brought over some cigarettes," said Philip,
with sudden change of base. "I'll bet you don't
dare to smoke one."</p>

<p>"I dare to but I don't want to. Nasty things!"</p>

<p>"You needn't pretend that you think they're
nasty; you're afraid to take even a whiff."</p>

<p>"I'd be ashamed to take a whiff."</p>

<p>"Why don't you own up that you're a sissy and
are afraid it will make you sick?"</p>

<p>May did not reply. "He isn't worth answering,"
she thought. "I wish I wasn't a girl—or if Gay
were here, he'd give it to him!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to smoke one. And you've got to,
whether you want to or not." Here Philip thrust
a cigarette and a match into May's hand. "Now
light it," he added.</p>

<p>May's reply was to tear the cigarette to pieces
and to put the match in her blouse pocket.</p>

<p>"Will you light this one?" Philip cried, angrily,
pressing a second cigarette into May's hand.</p>

<p>"No!" said May, throwing the cigarette down
and setting her heel on it.</p>

<p>"If you are a coward and a girl-boy, why, I can't
help it, but I'm going to smoke."</p>

<p>"If you are a tough and ill-bred, why I can't
help it, but I'm not going to smoke."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>After this interchange of opinions Philip lit a
match, touched it to the end of the cigarette with
the air of knowing just how it was done, then
threw the blazing match down carelessly on the
hay.</p>

<p>"You mustn't be so careless; you might set the
barn afire," said May, jumping up and stamping out
the match and a few wisps of blazing hay.</p>

<p>"What a fuss cat!" cried Philip, lighting a card
of matches and throwing them recklessly down.</p>

<p>He meant only to arouse May's resentment, and
threw them, as he supposed, far enough away from
the hay, but his estimate of the distance was incorrect,
and the matches fell into a depression in the
hay, and before May could snatch them out little
tongues of fire were darting in every direction.</p>

<p>"Help me, Philip!" she cried, trampling on the
flames as she talked. "We must put it out or the
barn will burn. It is full of hay and there is no
water here."</p>

<p>Philip looked at the rapidly spreading flames with
frightened eyes, then he ran out of the barn shouting
"Fire!" at the top of his lungs. The barn was
at some distance from the house and no one heard
him, so he kept on running until he reached the
house, when he entered the General's library without
ceremony, crying, "Come, quick, Gay's set the
barn on fire!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;"><a id="i_118fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_118fp.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">MAY FOUGHT THE FIRE HEROICALLY</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sarah! call the men; the lower barn is on
fire!" shouted the General.</p>

<p>Then he ran out of the house, Philip after him,
while Sarah, followed by Phyllis blowing lustily on
the horn that summoned the men-servants from the
fields, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>In the meantime May, with pale cheeks and terrified
eyes, was fighting fire, stamping, trampling
and jumping and saying the while, "Why doesn't
somebody come! Why doesn't somebody come!"</p>

<p>A light breeze blowing through the barn fanned
the flames until they were fast getting beyond her
control, when she spied some rubber squares for
protecting hay from dew and rain, and seizing one
she threw it over the fire, jumping and even rolling
on it until every spark was extinguished. When
the little band headed by the General reached the
barn she was looking ruefully at singed stockings
and knickerbockers.</p>

<p>"It's out, Uncle Harold!" May cried. "I guess
there's not much damage done."</p>

<p>"Never mind about the damage, my boy," replied
the General.</p>

<p>"Did you get burnt?" Sarah asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not much," said May.</p>

<p>The General was pondering Philip's cry, "Come
quick! Gay's set the barn afire!"</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" questioned the General.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>May and Philip were silent: Philip because he
didn't want to tell what he had done; May from a
sense of loyalty to Philip; she didn't want to tell
of him.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" the General repeated.</p>

<p>The children looked at one another; May expecting
Philip to speak; Philip wondering how he could
get out of it.</p>

<p>"Gay, why don't you answer me?" said the
General, sternly.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, sir," May answered, meaning
that Philip should understand that it was for him
to speak.</p>

<p>Then Philip, prompted by one of those evil impulses
that sometimes assail nobler natures than his,
whispered to the General, and very softly too, for
no one else heard him, "He's got a match in his
blouse pocket, now."</p>

<p>The General, as we know, was a man of quick
temper; when Philip's whisper reached his ear he
strode forward and thrust his hand in May's blouse
pocket, hoping, it is true, that the match would not
be there. Alas! it was there, and the General
drew it forth and held it up before everybody.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir, by refusing to tell me
who set the fire when you did it yourself!" thundered
the General. "Why didn't you own up like
a man!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>May threw an appealing glance at Philip, but
that young man did not appear to see it.</p>

<p>"I could have forgiven you your mischief but
not your cowardice," said the General.</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold," said May, "I didn't set——"</p>

<p>"Silence, sir," shouted the General. "Don't
criminate yourself further by falsehood."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>DARK DAYS</small></h2>


<p>Three days passed and still the General refused
to see May.</p>

<p>"When he will tell me the truth then will I see
him and not before," the General said in reply to
Sarah's solicitation in her favorite's behalf.</p>

<p>"He has told the truth," Sarah answered.</p>

<p>"The evidence is against him; he looked guilty;
he refused to speak; the match was found in his
pocket and the hay could not ignite itself," the
General said stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Evidence is nothing!" Sarah cried, with a
woman's disdain for hard facts. "He says he didn't
do it; that's enough for me and it ought to be for
you."</p>

<p>"There was the match——"</p>

<p>"Can't you get your mind off that one little
match?" interrupted Sarah, with scorn in her eyes
and in her voice. "A man will cling to a thing
like that and allow it to stifle his reason and instinct—no,
not that, for a man hasn't the instinct
of a June bug!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>"I was correct in my first estimate of his character;
he is a coward."</p>

<p>"Estimate!" sniffed Sarah. "I wouldn't give
much for an 'estimate' that makes a coward of a
boy who drilled till he dropped, put out a fire that
might have terrified a grown person, and bore all
those burns on his poor little hands and legs without
a whimper!" and she left the General to his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>The General's thoughts were not pleasant. He
had no doubt of his supposed nephew's guilt, and
it gave him great pain to reflect upon the duplicity
and cowardice that he thought he detected in the
child he already loved. Singularly enough he did
not think of Philip in connection with the fire.
The nature of Philip's communication—"Gay has
set the barn afire!" was calculated to mislead; the
General would have scorned to question Philip
further. He wanted Gay's confession, not Philip's
accusation, and in his morning calls at Dr. Brentwood's
he avoided Philip as carefully as that young
man avoided him.</p>

<p>Sarah was equally unsuspicious of Philip. Phyllis
was the only one who took a sensible view of
the matter; she believed that he knew more about
the fire than he was willing to tell. One day she
so far forgot her deference for her mistress as to
depart from her rule of monosyllables and say,—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>"That Brentwood boy knows more about the fire
than he tells. Perhaps he set it and Master Gay
didn't tell on him—expecting he'd tell himself—and
he saw his chance and kept quiet. That's what I
think."</p>

<p>"You had much better not think at all if you
can't think of something sensible!" Sarah replied.
"What makes you think so?" she added, a moment
later, not without curiosity.</p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am, but I do think so."</p>

<p>"I have my opinion of persons who don't know
why they think a thing. It all comes of your
stuffing your head with romantic nonsense instead
of doing something useful. You've read silly
romances till you've lost what little reasoning power
nature gave you."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Phyllis, meekly, but without altering
her opinion.</p>

<p>Sarah had once found a novel in Phyllis's room,
and from that time forth all of Phyllis's shortcomings,
from careless dusting to forgetfulness of
the thirty-nine articles of the Episcopalian faith, had
been ascribed by Sarah to the pernicious influence
of the romance!</p>

<p>Phyllis not only held to her opinion of May's
innocence but she did what she could to comfort
and cheer her. She could not, however, with all
her loving companionship, save May from many sad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>hours. At first May thought Philip would speak,
but as time went on and he remained silent she
resigned this hope. The General's refusal to take
her word closed her lips; not even to sympathetic
Phyllis and loyal Sarah did she mention her disgrace.
At times she thought of writing to her father,
telling all and allowing him to establish her innocence,
but the fear of annoying her sick mother,
an independent disposition to bear her own burdens
and the feeling that Philip must some time realize
the injustice of his conduct, and make amends for
it, withheld her. May's greatest comfort was
found in writing in her diary; there the whole story
was told, fully and accurately. She did not write
any letters at this time, she shrank from disclosing
the unhappy condition of affairs to the other conspirator,
whose daily letters were filled with glowing
descriptions of new friends and good times. Gay
was riding on the top wave of success and popularity
while she was wretched and in disgrace; it
was not strange, therefore, that the thought sometimes
obtruded itself, "Those good times might
have been mine if Gay had not persisted in keeping
on my clothes."</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Philip was satisfied
with himself; but he was a coward, and he not only
succeeded in dodging his conscience, but he was
even weak and wicked enough to take further
advantage of May.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the afternoon of the fourth day after the
fire and the General was in his library when Dr.
Brentwood came in, looking disturbed and even
angry.</p>

<p>"General," said he, "do you know what kind of
boy that nephew of yours is?"</p>

<p>The General grew red in the face; criticism of
any one "with Haines blood in their veins," to
use his frequent expression, was distasteful to him.</p>

<p>"As he is my nephew I presume he is, on the
whole, a very good kind of boy," he said, at length.</p>

<p>"He is a very bad kind of boy, indeed," the
doctor replied. "He is a dangerous boy."</p>

<p>"What has he done? Can't you speak out?"
roared the General.</p>

<p>"He gave Philip both cigarettes and tobacco,
threatening him with some form of torture if he
did not smoke them. We found the tobacco on
Philip's premises and forced him into a full confession
of your nephew's culpability."</p>

<p>"This explains the match and the fire," thought
the General. He said aloud, "I will question Gay
about the matter."</p>

<p>"He will deny it; Philip said he would, and the
poor boy begged me, with tears in his eyes, not to
tell you of it. I thought you ought to know it,
for, from what Philip says, Gay must be a hard
case," the doctor said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>The General rang the bell and Phyllis answered it.</p>

<p>"Send Gay here," commanded the General.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Phyllis, hurrying away, for she
surmised that the doctor's presence might be of
benefit to the unhappy child.</p>

<p>"Run, Gay," she said to May, when she found
her, "Dr. Brentwood is in the library, and they
want you."</p>

<p>"Philip has told," May thought, with delight.</p>

<p>She went quickly to the library and stood before
the General with a lighter heart than she had
carried since she had been in disgrace. "I'm all
right, now," thought she.</p>

<p>"Gay," said the General, sternly, "the doctor
tells me that you have given tobacco to Philip,
threatening him if he did not use it at your bidding.
What have you to say?"</p>

<p>Poor May! Her hope died away at those words.
For an instant she was tempted to cast aside her
disguise, to say, "I am a girl," and stand forth in
her true colors. No one would believe that a girl
had given a boy tobacco.</p>

<p>"Well," said the General, impatiently, "what
have you to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>"That it is not true," said May.</p>

<p>"I told you he would deny it," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"It is useless to deny it; Philip has said that
you did it," said the General.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>"Philip has said what is not true," May said.</p>

<p>"Do you question Philip's word?" blustered the
doctor.</p>

<p>"There is no question about it, sir; Philip
doesn't know how to speak the truth," May replied.</p>

<p>"Gay," said the General, in his most decided
manner, "I insist that you take back the words
you have spoken to Dr. Brentwood, and that you
promise to apologize to Philip."</p>

<p>"I can't take back what I have said, because it
is true. And I shall not apologize to Philip," May
answered, unflinchingly.</p>

<p>"Leave the room, sir!" shouted the General,
looking very red and angry.</p>

<p>Then when May had left the room to weep bitter
tears in the arms of the faithful Phyllis, the General
said,—</p>

<p>"Doctor, you see what a stubborn boy he is!
But he shall apologize handsomely to you and to
Philip before the week has passed."</p>

<p>And with this assurance the doctor went away.</p>

<p>When the doctor was gone the General summoned
Sarah and related the events that had just
occurred.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, with an ominous flash in his
deep-set eyes, "we will see what bread and water
and solitary confinement will do for the young
rebel."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who will play jailer?" Sarah asked, with eyes
that flashed as brightly as the General's. "I
certainly shall not."</p>

<p>"Then I will," said the General, with decision.</p>

<p>"You will be alone in the jail, for I shall not
keep house for a jailer," said Sarah with equal
decision. "Remember that!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE EVENT OF THE SEASON.</small></h2>


<p>Giving a tea-party at Rose Cottage was a serious
business. Miss Linn, Miss Celia, Margery and even
John were as busy as ants all the morning. There
were snow puddings, ices, cakes and custards to be
made, and nobody knows what these old-time housewives
and fosterers of dyspepsia did not deem necessary
for Gay's spread.</p>

<p>It was great fun at first to watch the work going
on; to have "tastes" of this or that offered for
one's verdict, and to eat all the little cakes that
refused to turn out of their tins as well-regulated
little cakes should. But even this position of taster-in-ordinary
grew monotonous, and the incessant
noise of the egg-beaters working in merry unison
seemed to whisk the thoughts out of Gay's head,
and he was glad to retire at an early hour from the
kitchen to the welcome quiet of his own room. It
cannot be said that his absence was regretted by the
cooks; in trying "to help" he had upset a freshly-iced
cake; dropped a glass dish of custard; spilled
a pitcher of milk; broken six eggs; and scalded his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>hand in lifting an open vessel of water off the stove;
not to mention his being a good deal in the way.</p>

<p>Gay had a reason for seeking his chamber; he
wished to look through poor May's depleted wardrobe
and see if there was a whole dress to wear to
the party. There were two; one a dainty white
muslin, the other a plain white lawn, both to be
worn, much to his disgust, with a sash. He instantly
rejected the dainty frock, which would have
been the real May's choice, because of bows of blue
ribbon on the shoulders and sleeves.</p>

<p>"None of that in mine!" he said, disdainfully,
rolling his sister's best frock in a wad and thrusting
it back into the trunk.</p>

<p>To wear with the plainer lawn dress he selected a
black sash, since he must wear one, as being more
quiet and gentleman-like. In honor of the occasion
he took some pains with his hands, but forgot to
take off his tennis shoes until Margery reminded
him of it.</p>

<p>"You must put on better shoes, Miss May,"
Margery said, who had been invited up-stairs to tie
the black sash. "And why don't you put on one
of those pretty bright sashes?"</p>

<p>"It isn't the thing to dress better than one's
guests," said sly Gay, with a wise air. "You
wouldn't want me to knock spots out of the girls,
would you?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mercy, no; you mustn't knock spots out o'
them girls. They are the nicest in town, Miss May.
No fighting with them, I beg of you. It was well
enough, perhaps, to take hold of them boys, for
they have tormented us to pieces all summer, but
you mustn't think of knocking spots out of them
fine young ladies."</p>

<p>"Oh, Margery, to knock spots out of anybody
doesn't mean to fight them!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't it? Well, I'm glad of it," said Margery,
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>When Gay was left alone he planned his campaign;
he meant to distinguish himself and make
his aunts proud of him, and to do this without
thought was beyond his ability. "I'll say something
to each one. That's the way mother does.
I'll act just like Alice! That's a bang-up idea!
And I mustn't forget that I'm a girl," thought he.</p>

<p>Having planned his line of conduct Gay went
down into the drawing-room, where Miss Linn and
Miss Celia sat in state, with a smiling decorum that
would have reflected credit upon the sweetest little
girl that ever lived—upon May, for example.</p>

<p>Very soon the guests, pretty, quiet little girls,
with correct and agreeable manners, as became the
descendants of Hazelnook's best families, began to
arrive. Gay met them with the best imitation of
Alice's manner that could be assumed at short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>notice; greeting them cordially and with such easy
grace that anxious Miss Linn was delighted.</p>

<p>"I must begin to say something to each one,"
thought Gay. "It looks easy when mother does
it, but I can't seem to get it in before they get out
of the way!"</p>

<p>"May, this is Ethel Payne," said Miss Celia, who
presented the girls to Gay.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Ethel?" Gay said, shaking
Ethel's hand warmly. "Do—ah—do—you play
ball?"</p>

<p>"No," answered astonished Ethel. "But my
brother Ned does."</p>

<p>"Does he? When is he coming?" asked Gay,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is not coming to-day; only girls are invited,
you know."</p>

<p>"Only girls! phew!" exclaimed Gay. Then
realizing that this was scarcely courteous, he added,
"How beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you seem to think so," laughed Ethel, as
she moved away.</p>

<p>"This is Mabel Bryant."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, Mabel," said Gay. "What
shall I say to her?" he thought. "Have you"—he
jerked out,—"have you been in swimming much
this summer?"</p>

<p>Mabel stared. "No," she said, rather primly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>"And here is Sadie Carver, May."</p>

<p>Gay turned delightedly to the new-comer. "I'm
awfully glad you came," he cried, seizing Sadie's
hand. "Is Lyman coming? You've a brother
named Lyman, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I have no brothers," said Sadie, looking very
much affronted, though Gay couldn't imagine why.</p>

<p>"That's a pity. Lyman is such a rattling good
fellow. He's captain of the Blue Stockings, and
his father who drives the stage is more fun than—a
tied goat."</p>

<p>Sadie's face grew very red. "Those Carvers are
no relation to us; they are a very common family,"
said she.</p>

<p>"I thought they were quite un-common, but I
may be mistaken," replied Gay, thinking that he
shouldn't like Sadie at all.</p>

<p>"May, this is Julia Paige, the doctor's daughter."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," said Gay.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Julia replied.</p>

<p>"Do you like living in Hazelnook?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I like living here," Julia answered, looking
somewhat surprised, perhaps at the question.</p>

<p>"Better—than in Russia, do you think?"</p>

<p>Julia's expression of surprise deepened. "I
don't know about Russia," she said.</p>

<p>"You might like Greece better?" hazarded Gay.
"Or, perhaps, Dakota?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p>Julia's reply to these remarkable questions was
not given, for just then a peal of the door bell
caused everybody to jump and to look through the
open door into the hall. Margery opened the door
and there stood Lyman, Robert, Will, Fred, Joe
and Herb.</p>

<p>"Excuse me!" cried Gay to astonished Miss
Celia. Then with a bound he was in the hall,
saying, "Come right in, fellows. I'm mighty glad to
see you."</p>

<p>By this time Miss Celia and Miss Linn were ready
to welcome the unexpected guests. After the
introductions were gone through with, the boys
drew a little apart and this gave Gay a chance to
say,—</p>

<p>"I invited them yesterday. I don't know how I
happened to forget to tell you. I suppose there
are ices enough, aren't there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said agitated Miss Linn.</p>

<p>Miss Celia watched the scene with interest; she
was anxious to see how the fusion of the antagonistic
elements was to be accomplished. She was
not kept long in suspense. Taking Lyman's arm
Gay led him round the room, introducing him to
each prim lassie, with contagious ease of manner.
After Lyman it was Robert's turn, then Will's, and
thus it went until all the boys had been introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Five terrible minutes followed. The boys huddled
together, looking as if they might leave at any
moment en masse, like a flock of frightened sheep!
The girls drew apart, looking as austere as merry
maidens of twelve summers can look. This would
never do! A bright idea seized Gay.</p>

<p>"Ethel, do the girls know how to play 'Going to
Jerusalem'?" he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "but I don't believe those
boys do."</p>

<p>"Boys can play any game naturally; they don't
need to know how," laughed Gay.</p>

<p>"How do you know so much about boys?"
asked Ethel, quizzically.</p>

<p>"By instinct," replied Gay, soberly, but with
laughing eyes.</p>

<p>It may not have been just the thing, but Gay
electrified the company by exclaiming,—</p>

<p>"Please take partners for 'Going to Jerusalem'!"</p>

<p>There was a hush over the room for an instant,
then Gay whispered to Lyman,—</p>

<p>"Brace up and ask Miss Ethel."</p>

<p>Lyman obeyed and that set the ball rolling.</p>

<p>"I will play," said Miss Celia.</p>

<p>"And, auntie, will you call?" said Gay.</p>

<p>"I will call," said Miss Linn, taking her place
by the piano.</p>

<p>Miss Celia struck the first chord and the game
began. There were plenty of mistakes at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>but they only served to break the ice of conventionality.
The boys behaved admirably; so,
strangely enough, did Gay; while the girls, led
by Julia and Ethel, soon became gracious and
natural. When they tired of the game Miss Linn
undertook to initiate them into the mysteries of
some old-fashioned games she had played in her
youth, and with intervals for rest, the fun continued
with increased enjoyment until they went out into
the dining-room.</p>

<p>White frock and sash entitled Gay to a seat; but
having played the active part of a boy for eleven
years it was hard for him to relapse into the passive
condition of a girl; to sit down and be waited
upon. So he threw conventionality to the winds
and flew about, serving the girls and helping the
boys do their duty.</p>

<p>"Auntie," Gay said to Miss Celia, when everybody
was chattering and laughing, and when even
austere Sadie was actually eating a bon-bon with a
member of the "common" Carver family, "I think
they are having a good time, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Aunt Celia, "you make a nice
hostess, dear."</p>

<p>"Mother always says try to make everybody glad
they came, and that is all there is to entertaining.
So I tried. Nice boys, aren't they? And the girls
are nice, too; particularly Ethel and Julia. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>think they felt a little snubby at first, but they
never showed their inside feelings a bit, and that's
pretty hard for a girl, for when she feels snubby
inside her nose goes up on the outside."</p>

<p>After supper there were more games and Dumb
Crambo formed an edifying feature of the entertainment,
but the party came to an end at length
as all good things must in time. Everybody went
away in high spirits. The boys expressed their
pleasure in unqualified terms.</p>

<p>"It is the nicest time we ever had in Hazelnook,"
said Lyman, as the spokesman for the party. "Nobody
else ever treated us as square as Brown has,
and we are much obliged to her for it."</p>

<p>This was not an elegant adieu, perhaps, but it
was sincere.</p>

<p>"Lyman," whispered the unblushing recipient of
this praise, "don't forget to let me know about the
ball game to-morrow; I'll get out, some way."</p>

<p>When the last guests were gone Gay and the
aunts went into the drawing-room to talk it over.</p>

<p>"Pretty jolly time, wasn't it?" asked Gay, with
a smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The best of it is that it will do both the boys
and the girls good to be brought together," said
Miss Celia, "and I doubt if it would have been
done if you had not come to Hazelnook."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Gay, earnestly, "I can't see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>any sense in putting one kind of people in one lump
and another in another and having them think
that they're different kind of folks, because they
aren't at all, as you can tell easily enough if you
take one out of each lump and change them
about?"</p>

<p>"You were a niece to be proud of to-day, May,"
said Miss Linn, who was gratified at her young
relation's social success, and not disposed to discuss
the laws governing society in general.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'm much of a niece," said Gay,
with a wicked grin, "but I'm glad if you are
pleased with me. I meant to make them have a
whooping old time."</p>

<p>And the two gentle aunts heard this outburst of
slang without changing color, and in silence, so
rapid had been their educational progress since the
advent of their supposed niece.</p>

<p>A little later when Gay was taking off frock and
sash in his room, his self-satisfaction was disturbed
by an unpleasant thought, and he ran to the
banisters and called,</p>

<p>"Aunt Celia, isn't it a shame; I forgot to ask
Patsey. He's a splendid boy—I hope he won't
feel hurt."</p>

<p>The aunts exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"She's hopeless!" sighed Miss Linn.</p>

<p>"A little lacking in social instinct, perhaps,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>faltered Miss Celia, as bewildered by this remark as
her sister, but determined not to own it. "I've no
doubt," she said, with unexpected inspiration,
"that she will grow up to be a very elegant
woman; such harum-scarums often do."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE BELLE OF HAZELNOOK</small></h2>


<p>Gay awoke the next morning, feeling that something
delightful was in prospect.</p>

<p>"What is it, I wonder?" questioned the sleeper,
just summoned from dreamland. "Oh, I know, it's
the ball-game!"</p>

<p>Gay sprang out of bed and ran to the window to
see if the weather was clear. Yes; the sun was up,
smiling his most charming welcome, and Gay began
to dress with the reckless haste of one who must be
up and away. Such haste was unnecessary; the
ball-game was not to be played until afternoon, but
having something to look forward to adds impetus
to one's movements.</p>

<p>"I must put on a strong waist; I don't want my
clothes to fall apart on the diamond!" said Gay to
himself. "That's the worst of being a girl; it's such
a bother to keep picking out dresses. Yesterday I
wore this white dress, but I can't put it on to-day.
No, I have to hunt through the closet for something
else. This flannel blazer will be just the thing to
wear with this flannel skirt; it's ripped a little but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>I guess it will hold. I don't dare to say anything
about it for fear Aunt Beulah will make me mend
it! I wonder if I can run in skirts. I guess I'll
take a turn in the back yard and find out!"</p>

<p>No one was astir but Margery, who was at work
in the kitchen when Gay came in.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Margery."</p>

<p>"What are ye up so early for? Ain't ye tired
after your party?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Nice party, wasn't it, and aren't
those splendid boys, particularly Lyman?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, they ain't bad boys for common folks,
but there are ever so many nicer boys in the village,
Miss May; real, little fine gentlemen, an' their
fathers and grandfathers before them were gentlemen."</p>

<p>"They are not anything but boys, are they?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not; but they are different from
that stuff that was here last night."</p>

<p>"Boys are boys, that's all they are. There are
two kinds, perhaps; cads, cowards, tell-tales and
mean boys are one kind; the splendid fellows are
the other kind. There are poor cads and rich cads;
rich splendid fellows and poor splendid fellows;
white cowards and black cowards, and white mean
fellows and black mean fellows. You see, Margery,
you can't tell a bit by a fellow's father what he'll
be; you've got to judge by the fellow himself. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>he is all right he is and that's the end of it. If he
isn't right, why, that's the end of it, too, for everybody
jumps the cad or the coward just as quick as
he shows his colors."</p>

<p>"It's a mystery how you know so much about
boys, Miss May."</p>

<p>"I play with boys all the time."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think your ma and pa would like
that."</p>

<p>"They do like it."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a mystery! It's all along o' them
higher edication notions, Miss Linn says, but I don't
understand it. Times have changed since your ma
was brought up fifteen or twenty years ago. I
don't know what they'll be twenty years from now
when maybe you'll be a ma yourself."</p>

<p>"And maybe not!" laughed Gay, leaving the
kitchen and going out into the shady backyard, for
his morning practise. Exercises were about to
commence when Lyman came into the yard.</p>

<p>"Game's off, Brown," said he.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Gay, anxiously.</p>

<p>"We were going to play the Plainvilles but their
captain is off his base and we'll have to put it off
till Saturday or maybe Monday. We'll let you
know of course if you still think you'd like to come."</p>

<p>"Well, I should smile!"</p>

<p>Lyman laughed when this slang cameo fell from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>Gay's lips. "You are the greatest girl I ever
saw!" said he.</p>

<p>"I dare say I am," said Gay.</p>

<p>"And the nicest," said Lyman, thinking his first
remark not very complimentary. "You're not a
bit like other girls; you're so square and such sport.
Are there any more like you in New York?"</p>

<p>"Lots," said Gay, thinking what fun it would be
when Lyman found out the truth. "I've a sister—we
call her Brownie—she's twice as good as I am.
She is as square as a brick and full of fun. She
isn't quite as handy with her fists as I am, but she's
quick, I can tell you! She can swim like a fish,
she can play a fine game of tennis, and she's just
the best girl going. You can't put her anywhere
that she doesn't come to time."</p>

<p>"She must be a daisy! How old is she?"</p>

<p>"About my age; I hope you'll see Brownie some
day—you'd like her. She——" Gay paused
abruptly. How was it faring with that absent sister?
Well or ill? Well, of course, he reasoned,
it was so easy to be a boy!</p>

<p>Easy for a boy, certainly, but at that very moment
the little girl in Cedarville was finding it exceedingly
difficult to be a boy. While Gay was the heroine
of Hazelnook May was the hero of Cedarville, but
with what varying degrees of success and pleasure
were their positions attended. Gay was popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>and happy; May was unhappy and in disgrace.
Their even exchange had not worked evenly.</p>

<p>"I must be off; I've got to work haying to-day,"
said Lyman.</p>

<p>"I'd love to work in a hay-field—to ride on a big
rake, or do you use the little ones with long handles?"
asked Gay, with eager interest.</p>

<p>"Both; little and big horse rakes. They wouldn't
let you come, would they?" said Lyman, meaning
the aunts by "they."</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"If you can come I'll tell you the way. Keep
right on past the post office till you come to a big
meadow—you'll see me there."</p>

<p>"I'll show up if I can."</p>

<p>"Some of the other fellows will be there and
they will be glad to see you. I'll tell you what it
is, Brown, there isn't one of us but would do anything
for you, for there isn't another swell young
miss in the place that would have acted as you have
right along."</p>

<p>"Drop the swell, can't you? There's only one
kind of a swell worth mentioning—the square one—and
I'm not that. You wouldn't think so if you
knew me."</p>

<p>"You can deny it," said Lyman earnestly, "but
you'd feel as we do if you had lived in a country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>town all your life and no one looked at you except
they wanted some work done at Christmas or
Easter or a Sunday-school picnic, and then somebody
that people thought a swell should come and
take you by the hand and treat you like—anybody.
That's what you did."</p>

<p>"I took you under the ear, first," remarked
Gay.</p>

<p>This unfeminine, if playful, rejoinder did not
disconcert Lyman. "Well, wasn't that treating
me like an equal?" he asked, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I think I understand it. All the talk about
being equal is bosh, I think, but it is enough to
make one act like sin to be treated as if one was of
no account. But you boys ought to brace up and
show what you call swells that you are better than
they are. That's the way to get even with such
people; be really nicer than they are."</p>

<p>Lyman looked admiringly at Gay. "You'd
make anybody try," said he, "I never heard the
minister say anything half as brightening-up like."</p>

<p>"What minister? The one that hangs out here
all the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Of course he never said anything but his
prayers! And I'll bet he says them looking in
the glass. Why, he doesn't know the boys in his
congregation—what kind of a father would a man
be if he didn't know the children in his family?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>And a congregation is just a large family, that's
all."</p>

<p>"But people say he's going to marry your Aunt
Celia."</p>

<p>"That milk and water—mostly water—man?
Not much, my boy! Aunt Celia's head is too
level for that."</p>

<p>When Lyman was gone away Gay wondered if
the gossip about his aunt and the minister was
true. "If it is," he said to himself, "I'll never
call him uncle; not even to please Aunt Celia.
When they ask me I'll say—politely, of course,
but so they'll know I mean it—'Do you think
I'll call him uncle? Not much!'"</p>

<p>It was not until afternoon that Gay had an opportunity
to join his friends in the hay-field.
Once there he soon became the centre of attraction;
the boys clustered round and were so delightfully
cordial in their manners—Lyman had
duly reported the conversation of the morning—that
Gay was quite overcome and felt like telling
the truth and having some kind of a real boy's game
to knock the edge off their compliments. He did
so far forget himself as to suggest leap frog, but
the boys declined the honor, possibly from a sense
of propriety. The boys were occasionally surprised
by the freedom of Gay's manner, but as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Robert said, later, when the subject was under discussion,
"It isn't altogether Brown's manners that
we're stuck on; it's her friendliness and because
we know she is true blue."</p>

<p>Gay was introduced to the men in the fields, who
showed their appreciation of the supposed "she"
by inviting her to ride on the load of hay. Gay not
only accepted the invitation but helped put the hay
in the stable-driver's barn. It was a charming afternoon
and the youthful haymakers enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"Making hay knocks spots out of parties!"
said Gay. "I never had such fun in my life."</p>

<p>Ethel Payne, her brother Ned, and the minister,
of course, were on the porch when Gay came home.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" said Miss Linn. "We
have looked everywhere for you, dear."</p>

<p>"I've been helping Mr. Carver get his hay in.
It was fun. I drank molasses and water out of a
stone jug and I got almost all of it in my mouth; a
little of it went down my neck, but not much."</p>

<p>The minister tried not to look disgusted; jolly
Ethel tried not to laugh; Ned tried not to stare;
the aunts tried not to look displeased—and all did
precisely what they tried not to do.</p>

<p>"But you didn't ask permission, dear," said Miss
Celia, reproachfully. This sudden relapse into evil
ways after the excellent behavior of yesterday was
mortifying to the lady.</p>

<p>"I know it, auntie," said Gay, stealing his arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>around Miss Celia's neck. "If I had asked permission
you wouldn't have let me go."</p>

<p>Miss Celia smiled at this reasoning, and Ned and
Ethel laughed.</p>

<p>"It must have been fun on the hay," said Ethel.
"Mustn't it, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd have liked it myself," said Ned,
graciously.</p>

<p>"Come with me to-morrow morning, won't you?"
asked Gay. "Mr. Carver has another load to get
in and the boys would be glad to see you."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure of that," said Ned. "They are
always firing stones at us Academy fellows."</p>

<p>"What did you Academy boys do first? Something,
I'll bet."</p>

<p>"May, you must try not to use slang," murmured
Miss Linn.</p>

<p>"Uncle George says slang is picturesque English,"
laughed mischievous Gay. "I try not to use it,
for mother says she doesn't like too much of it, but
it slips in. It's such handy stuff, you always find
it when you want it, and sometimes when you don't,
and that's more than you can say of proper words.
But, Ned, what have the Academy fellows
done?"</p>

<p>"We may have called them a name or two," admitted
Ned.</p>

<p>"And they answered with a stone about as hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>as your name. Well, I don't see much to choose
between stones and names," said Gay.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Ned. He was not insensible
to Gay's reasoning, but he was not quite ready to
admit its truth.</p>

<p>"I fear, Miss May," began the minister, endeavoring
to speak pleasantly, although feeling an un-Christian
desire to shake this terrible child, "I fear
that your parents would not approve of your intimacy
with these boys; they are uncultivated and
otherwise undesirable acquaintances."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said Gay, with exasperating
politeness, "you said you didn't know the boys;
if you don't how do you know that they are uncultivated
and undesirable?"</p>

<p>"I know the class they represent," explained the
minister, not without impatience, for he did not like
to be argued with by a child.</p>

<p>"If they are uncultivated I should think a good
way to keep them so would be for cultivated people
to avoid knowing them," Gay said, slowly.</p>

<p>"I fear you are a hopeless radical, Miss May,"
the minister said with a desire to bring the conversation
to an end.</p>

<p>"Radical" was a new word to Gay, but he grasped
its meaning after a moment's thought. "I am afraid I
am," said he, "if radical means somebody who thinks
one person should be treated as well as another."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE SKY BRIGHTENS</small></h2>


<p>The General must have thought his housekeeper
too valuable to lose, for May was neither placed
under lock and key nor condemned to prison fare of
bread and water. In one way this order of severity
would have been easier to bear than daily meetings
with the silent General. Only a child of coarse
calibre can stand out against the silent condemnation
of an elder; to May, who had lived in an atmosphere
of sunshine, the General's demeanor was
well-nigh unbearable. Confession trembled on her
lips more than once, but was repressed.</p>

<p>"What good will it do to tell?" she argued with
herself. "Uncle Harold will not believe what I
say until something happens to change his opinion
of me."</p>

<p>The last accusation, that of sowing the seeds of
tobacco-using, did not trouble May greatly. That
would be easily disposed of when it was known that
she was a girl; no one, then, would believe that
she had given a boy tobacco. But a girl might fire
a heap of hay and tell a fib about it afterwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>both acts being within a girl's province of wickedness.
And if Philip never told, and if her uncle
continued to disbelieve her, might not everybody,
Gay, father, mother, all, believe her guilty?
This thought brought May to the verge of despair.</p>

<p>Every morning a message was brought to May,
"Will you apologize?" And to this message the
unvarying reply was returned, "No, sir."</p>

<p>This exchange of semi-hostilities was the only intercourse
between May and her uncle. The General
began to feel some respect for a nature that
could hold out against the enemy and refuse to
yield even under continuous siege. "He's a naughty
boy, but I believe he has the making of a soldier,"
thought the old man.</p>

<p>One day the uncle and the mock nephew encountered
one another on the porch.</p>

<p>"Well, boy," said the uncle sitting down as if to
make ready for a confession.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harold, if you would only believe
me!" cried May, overcome by this unwonted gentleness.</p>

<p>"I will when you tell the truth; take back your
words to the doctor and apologize to Philip," the
General replied.</p>

<p>"Can't you see that I'm telling the truth and
that I can't apologize to Philip?" May exclaimed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>earnestly, clasping her hands on the General's arm
and looking into his eyes.</p>

<p>The General rose, and put aside the clinging
hands. He wanted to take the childish figure in
his arms and forgive all that had passed, but the
determination to conquer the stubborn will opposed
to his own withheld him.</p>

<p>"I shall say no more about the matter. When
you have anything to tell me you can seek me," he
said, and then he walked away to hide his feelings.</p>

<p>"Philip did it!" May's lips formed these words,
but no sound came from them. "Tell him," an
inward voice whispered. May looked after the
retreating figure; its outline was so stern that her
courage faded and she turned hopelessly away
in the other direction. "What is the use; he
wouldn't believe me," she said to herself.</p>

<p>This encounter bore good fruit, however. It
helped May to make an effort to lift the heavy cloud
of suspicion that rested upon her. In the afternoon
she asked Phyllis to walk over to the village with
her.</p>

<p>"If Miss Sarah is willing," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>Sarah was willing, but when Phyllis said, "He's
going to make that Brentwood boy speak out," she
said, "Haven't you got that idea out of your head
yet?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Sarah," Phyllis replied, "I'm surer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>it than ever since Dr. Brentwood said Gay had
given Philip tobacco—the idea of it! That Philip is
a little scamp; you see if I am not right."</p>

<p>This decided expression of opinion from her
meek serving-maid so surprised Sarah that she
allowed Phyllis to depart without saying a word!</p>

<p>It was indeed May's intention to see Philip, but
when Dr. Brentwood's was reached they were told
that Philip had gone, with a companion, to play
near the lake. "But the doctor is in his office,"
said the maid, looking significantly at May.</p>

<p>It was plain that she knew the whole story, and
thought the young caller had come to make the
expected apology, and so, also, thought the doctor,
who was looking through the window and trying to
persuade himself not to be too severe with the corrupter
of Philip's morals.</p>

<p>"I don't care to see the doctor," May replied,
with rising color. Then she added, "I am going
to the lake, Phyllis."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Phyllis, now more than ever
convinced of the insight of her conjectures.</p>

<p>Philip and his friend were in a boat a short
distance from the shore. They were not rowing
but drifting, and rocking the boat from side to
side.</p>

<p>"I want to see you, Philip; come ashore, please."</p>

<p>The rocking ceased. "I don't want to see you,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>Philip answered, telling the truth, in its deepest
significance, unintentionally. "I shall not come
ashore." And the rocking was resumed.</p>

<p>"You will have to come ashore some time; I will
wait for you," May answered. "Sit down, Phyllis;
I shall wait for him if I stay all night."</p>

<p>They sat down on the grass-fringed edge of the
lake. Philip and his companion rocked, and jumped,
and shouted noisily. They were too far distant for
May or Phyllis to hear how it began, but presently
they began to dispute and to push each other, and
then, somehow—for no one ever knows how such accidents
occur—they made a false movement, the boat
tipped over on one side, and they went into the
water with a great splash. The boat righted itself
and swung idly on the little waves.</p>

<p>"They will drown!" shouted Phyllis, springing
to her feet.</p>

<p>"No, they won't," said May. "They will get a
good wetting, that's all. The water can't be deep;
besides, Philip told me he could swim."</p>

<p>"They are not swimming," said Phyllis. "We'd
better go for somebody."</p>

<p>"Help!" shouted one of the boys, coming to the
surface.</p>

<p>At this cry May threw her hat on the bank and
walked into the water without a word.</p>

<p>"Come back!" cried Phyllis, in alarm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<p>But May kept on. By this time the water was
on a level with her chest, and she struck out boldly.
She was a fearless swimmer and the distance was
short, but as she swam along she could not help
thinking, uneasily, "I wonder if I can manage
both!"</p>

<p>When she reached them Philip was doing his utmost,
in his fright, to drown himself and his companion,
and must have succeeded in doing so if May
had not arrived. She grasped him by the back, and
they rose to the surface, where she made him understand
that he must loose his hold of his companion.
This he did and clung to May instead, plunging,
struggling, and screaming, but she was equal to him,
and by scolding, persuading and even threatening him
she kept him afloat until the other boy, who could
swim very well, recovered his breath, then together
they got Philip ashore.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have held him a minute longer,"
gasped the boy, when they were on land again.
"Philip hung hold of me so—why, I should think
he must have been as strong as ten men—and he
grabbed me every time I tried to swim a stroke and
pulled me down. Oh, it was awful!"</p>

<p>"I thought you could swim," said May, "else I'd
have been there sooner."</p>

<p>She didn't say "Philip told me he could swim,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>and for the first time since their acquaintance began,
Philip appreciated May's forbearance and
realized that the "girl-boy," "coward," and "sissy,"
had returned his evil conduct with good. His
shame would have increased had he known that he
was indebted to a girl for his safety.</p>

<p>"You're a good swimmer," said Philip's companion.</p>

<p>"I ought to be," said May, beginning to wring
blouse and knickerbocker to get rid of the water.
"Father taught my brother and me to swim when
we were four years old, and he says we took to the
water as naturally as Newfoundland puppies. How
do you feel, Philip?" May added, with an anxious
glance at Philip, who had not spoken, and who stood
at her side, shivering, and looking blue and pinched
about his nose and mouth.</p>

<p>"Queer," Philip replied, faintly.</p>

<p>"You must move around," May said, taking
Philip's hands and chafing them smartly. "The
best thing to do is to start for home. Wring yourself
out a little, Philip; then we'll go."</p>

<p>But Philip protested that he was dying and
couldn't walk a step, and that somebody must go for
his grandfather's carriage.</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Philip's friend.</p>

<p>"No," said May, decidedly, "Philip must keep
moving or he'll take cold. Come, Philip, take my
arm, and your friend——"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>"My name is Rob Lawrence," interrupted the boy.</p>

<p>"And Rob will take your other arm, and you can
get along nicely," May continued.</p>

<p>Philip took the proffered arms very meekly and
the procession moved; Philip, Rob and May abreast,
and Phyllis in the next rank, carrying May's hat and
weeping quietly from sheer excitement. When they
reached the Brentwood's, they helped exhausted
Philip in at a side door. "I want you to come in
with me," he said.</p>

<p>"I can't, I'm so wet," said May; "I'll come
down by and by."</p>

<p>"I want you to come in now; I may be dead by
and by," said Philip, tragically.</p>

<p>So they went in, Rob, May, and Phyllis, the latter
privately convinced that some new infliction was in
store for her favorite. This was an unnecessary
suspicion, as she soon learned.</p>

<p>The maid preceded them into the drawing-room,
crying,—</p>

<p>"Oh, docther, docther, Master Philip is drownded,
and the Gineral's boy pulled him out alive!"</p>

<p>Then there was a great flurry! Grandmamma
Brentwood tried to faint and the General, who was
making an afternoon call, supplied her with water,
and a bouquet of roses, from a handy vase! The
water and indignation brought the old lady out of
her swoon, and just then Philip and May and Rob,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>all dripping like half-wrung clothes, came in,
followed by faithful Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Grandpapa!" said Philip, and oh, how hard
the words came! "when I was drowning—I
threw the matches in the hay. I didn't really mean
to do it—I was ashamed when I was being pulled
ashore—that tobacco and stuff was mine—and—Gay
told the truth and I—didn't!"</p>

<p>This was incoherent, but everybody understood
it. The General opened his arms to May, then and
there, and she nestled within them and nobody as
much as thought of the damage her water-soaked
clothing might do to the General's "old-school"
finery. Doctor and Mrs. Brentwood looked sadly
at their shame-faced grandchild. As for Phyllis,
it was the happiest moment of her life—not only was
her pet completely vindicated, but now she could
prove to her mistress that her reasoning powers had
not been injured by excess of romance reading.</p>

<p>The doctor was ashamed of the part his belief in
Philip had caused him to play. "Gay," said he,
"why didn't you tell in the first place that Philip
set the hay afire?"</p>

<p>"I thought Philip would tell," May replied.
"And he has told and that is all there is about it."
May glanced at Philip with a forgiving smile, and
he smiled in return, with full appreciation of her
magnanimity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>"No, that is not all," said the doctor, sternly.
"You shall say what punishment shall be Philip's."</p>

<p>"Punishment!" echoed May in astonishment.
"I should think he'd had enough already! with
doing what he was ashamed of, and half drowning
besides."</p>

<p>"He'd have been wholly drowned if it hadn't been
for you. And so would I," Rob ventured to say.</p>

<p>"What shall we do to him?" persisted the
doctor. "He made you suffer; it is only justice
that you should select his punishment."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't call that justice," said May decidedly.
"I should call it paying him back, and father
won't let us think of doing such things. If you
please, Doctor Brentwood, I think we'll call it square
as it is." She turned to Philip and added, earnestly,
"You won't be so hateful again, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," Philip replied, so soberly that May did not
doubt his sincerity.</p>

<p>Then somebody was wise enough to realize that
the children were courting lung fever and rheumatism.
May scampered for home, and was dressed
in a dry suit before the General and Phyllis got
there, and before Sarah knew anything about it.</p>

<p>When Sarah heard the story she expressed no
surprise. "Phyllis and I have thought for some
time that Philip knew more about it than he chose
to tell," she said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<p>This cool assertion naturally surprised Phyllis,
but a little later she received a second shock of surprise
beside which the first faded into insignificance.
Sarah gave her a bunch of keys, saying,—</p>

<p>"The keys of the small storeroom. Hereafter
you will deal out the stores to the farm hands.
Anybody that ferreted out Philip's mischief deserves
to have the control of keys." Then, because
Phyllis didn't know what to say, she added, "Take
them; don't stand there looking as if you hadn't an
idea in your head."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Phyllis, accepting the keys without
another word.</p>

<p>As for the General, he held May on his knees all
the evening, so proud, so happy, and so contrite
was he. May would hear no reproaches, but the
General silently vowed never again to doubt his
"little soldier."</p>

<p>But bless you, he did! Within twenty-four
hours the unfortunate "little soldier" was once
more in disgrace.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE DEAREST GIRL</small></h2>


<p>The next morning Dr. Brentwood drove over to
the General's with a message from Philip; he was
sick in bed; would Gay come and see him?</p>

<p>"Why, of course I'll go," said sympathetic May.
"And I'll stay as long as he wants me."</p>

<p>This answer seemed so broad-minded, viewed in
the light of the recent events, that the General saw
May drive away with the doctor with feelings of
pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>"He's the finest boy I have ever known!" the
General said to Sarah.</p>

<p>"I told you so, but you called him a 'molly cott'
and a 'girl boy.'"</p>

<p>"I admit my error. Fancy my calling that
manly little fellow such names! A boy of the best
type, Sarah; an out-and-out boy."</p>

<p>"Anybody can see that. I don't take any credit
to myself for seeing just what kind of a boy he is,
for honesty, sincerity and loveableness shine right
out on his bright little face, bless him!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>"That is true, Sarah. Still, I believe that the
first day he came you said you didn't take any stock
in him—how is that?"</p>

<p>"Quite a different thing. But I can't waste my
time here; I've something to do elsewhere," and
Sarah hurried away, leaving the General smiling
broadly.</p>

<p>Once in awhile, as often as a very wicked man
has a good impulse, let us say, the General enjoyed
a quiet laugh at the expense of his housekeeper,
and it made him feel at peace with all mankind. It
was in a very agreeable frame of mind, therefore,
that he sought his library and picked up what he
believed to be a book of the Æneid, opened it at
random, and at a passage that was worse than Greek
to him. It was:</p>

<p>"<i>Wednesday</i>—I wish I had never tried to be a
Boy. I drilled this morning with Uncle Harold and
a dreadful rifle. I blistered my hands, carrying
the gun that wanted to explode and kill everybody,
and my heels marching front rank obleek."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" exclaimed the General; then he
read the next entry.</p>

<p>"<i>Thursday.</i>—I don't mind drilling with a rifle
that has cotton wool in it. I wish Gay was here
and I was in Hazelnook. I don't like to deceve.
Uncle H. half-and-half likes me; Sarah and Fillis
like me. I wish I could have a dress like Fillises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>and Miss Sarah's. When I am a girl again I shall
ask mother if I may have one, and wear a little
apron and a kerchief, and have a bunch of kees.
I have two kees of my own, and Gay might let me
have the kee to his tool chest; then he would know
where it was. I don't think my uncle is very hospityable;
but, maybe, that is my punishment for
letting him think I am a boy. They got punished
in Bible times, for things they did—grasshoppers
like a cloud and lots more; and I think people get
punished now—not grasshoppers, perhaps, because
there aren't enough now to go round. There is a
tiny, wee chest in the attic filled with a little girl's
clothes. I put them all on. It seemed good and very
natcheral, too, although the dresses must be a hundred
and seventy-five years old, at least. I like
knickerbockers. I rode bareback on old Kate, the
roan mare, yesterday, and climbed to the top of the
tree in the corner of the garden, and I did it a
great deal easier than I could in skirts.</p>

<p>"P. S.—I musn't forget the officer's salute."</p>

<p>"<i>In the afternoon.</i>—We are friends! Now I
feel worse than I did before, because I am deseving
somebody that likes me."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" thought the General,
when he had read these remarkable disclosures.
"Is Gay a girl? Is he my nephew or my niece,
or somebody else altogether! If he—she—has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>been cheating me all this time I shall never forgive
him—her, I mean."</p>

<p>Then, stifling his conscience by saying that he
was not spying, but looking into something that
needed to be looked into—I am not sure that he
did not say, "For the good of the commonwealth!"—the
General finished reading the poor little
journal, all blotted as it was with ink and tears.
As he read, his emotions ranged from pity to anger;
from anger back to pity again. He pitied the suffering
of the child; he was angry at the deceit
that had been practised upon him.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" he called, when he had read the last
entry made that morning in his own library, and
possibly interrupted by the arrival of the doctor,
for a sentence was left unfinished. "Sarah, come
here!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Sarah, appearing at the
door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the General.</p>

<p>Sarah entered the room, and seated herself with
an ill-concealed air of indifference in the most uncomfortable
chair in the room. She never sat in a
comfortable chair during an interview with the
General; it seemed as if she feared being led into
a state of amiable receptivity if her body were at
ease; it was her way of delivering herself from
temptation to be acquiescent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>"An unexpected complication," the General
began. "A most unexpec——"</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Sarah, cutting him
short.</p>

<p>"Read this and see for yourself," the General
replied, extending May's journal.</p>

<p>Sarah took the leather-bound book and read it
through without comment.</p>

<p>"Well," said the General, impatiently, "what
do you think of it? Have you ever known such
duplicity?"</p>

<p>"No duplicity about it," Sarah said, contrary-minded,
as usual. "These children went into it
for a 'lark,' as Gay—May, I mean—says here. Just
think of that dear little girl drilling, putting out
fires, keeping up during that Brentwood scrape, and
pulling that boy out of the pond! I declare, when
I think of that Philip, I'd like to shake him. If
our child is a girl, she is the pluckiest one I have
ever seen!"</p>

<p>"Sarah!" said the General, weakly, "you are
the most inconsistent woman I have ever known."</p>

<p>"You haven't known women enough to be able
to judge of my inconsistency," Sarah rejoined,
dryly.</p>

<p>"I shall write to their father and to Hazelnook
to-night," said the General, glad to change the
subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>"If you've a grain of sense you'll do nothing of
the sort," Sarah exclaimed. "Those children kept
quiet that their mother might not be troubled, and
you mustn't break up all their plans."</p>

<p>"I will take Gay, or May, or whichever it is,
down to Hazelnook to-morrow, and straighten out
matters there," said the General.</p>

<p>"It would be a good idea to stop this masquerading
just where it is," Sarah admitted. "You had
better bring Gay—May—back with you, unless you
prefer the boy, and let her finish her visit here in
her own clothes."</p>

<p>"I don't think I prefer the boy," the General
said rather sheepishly. "Still——"</p>

<p>"You know you love that child better than you
could love fifty boys!" cried Sarah. "We don't
want a noisy boy in the house."</p>

<p>"What? Not a boy whose 'honesty, sincerity
and lovableness shine right out on his dear little
face?'" laughed the General.</p>

<p>"No, nor 'an out and out boy!'" Sarah retorted.
"I'm afraid you can't go until after to-morrow,"
she added. "May writes: 'Gay has spoiled all my
pretty summer dresses,' in one of her entries, and
we shall have to make her some sort of a frock before
she can go, for that boy hasn't left her a rag,
and you may be sure he'll want his jackets and
trousers when he sees them again."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>The General laughed.</p>

<p>"What a pair of madcaps they must be when
they are together!" he said.</p>

<p>"Bring them both back with you," said Sarah,
heartily. "It is cruel to separate them any longer."</p>

<p>"It would suit me perfectly," said the General.
"But do you want two children in the house?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Sarah replied. "There is room
enough for a dozen, and it will brighten up this
dull old house a bit." She turned to the General
and demanded, defiantly, "Did you ever hear me
say I didn't like children?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I ever did," replied the General,
meekly.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Sarah.</p>

<p>And that ended their conversation.</p>

<p>When May came home late in the afternoon, the
General, Sarah and Phyllis were on the porch.</p>

<p>"How is Philip?" asked the General.</p>

<p>"Lots and lots better," said May. "I played
checkers and read and sung and told stories about
our children at home, and made him forget his cold—and
what he did. Philip is all right, I think;
getting into the water seemed to wash the naughty
all out of him."</p>

<p>"You are a genuine reformer, little <em>girl</em>!" said
the General.</p>

<p>His emphasis was so marked that May looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>at him an instant, then threw herself into his arms,
crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, who told you? Has Gay told the aunties?
Does mother know?"</p>

<p>"Your journal told," said Sarah, smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad it did," cried May, emphatically. "I
was never so tired of being myself as I am of being
somebody else!"</p>

<p>She ran up to Sarah and kissed her rapturously;
then to Phyllis and kissed her three, four, yes, six,
times. With her arms around Phyllis's neck, May
said,—</p>

<p>"You couldn't have been kinder to me when I
was unhappy if you had been my own sister. You
just believed in me without question, and that's
true friendship."</p>

<p>Phyllis was too happy at this praise even to answer,
but May knew the reason of her silence and
saved her the trouble of replying, saying,—</p>

<p>"Will you all excuse me a minute, please?"
Then she darted into the house before they could
speak.</p>

<p>They excused her five, ten, fifteen minutes, and
then she returned. Knickerbockers and blouse were
gone, and in their place was a quaint white frock,
with low, short waist and elaborate full sleeves covered
with exquisite embroidery.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>"Katherine's dress!" exclaimed Sarah, looking
at the General.</p>

<p>"I found it in the little cedar chest in the attic,"
said May, looking at her waist and sleeves with
admiring eyes. "Doesn't it fit well? May I
wear these clothes while I stay, Miss Sarah? They
fit, for I tried them on a week ago and they look
just like my dresses, only mine are not so much
like silk. May I wear them? I won't hurt them
a bit!"</p>

<p>Sarah looked at the General, who nodded his
head vigorously.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may wear them," Sarah said. "They
belonged to your little great-aunt, Katherine Haines,
who died sixty years ago."</p>

<p>"Poor little great-aunt," said May, looking sad
and touching the fine India muslin frock reverently.</p>

<p>But May's pensive mood did not last. Seizing
the General's walking stick she took the soldier's
position, arms at a carry, and in an excellent imitation
of the General's manner, shouted,——</p>

<p>"Fire as by single rank. Ready, aim, fire!"</p>

<p>These commands she executed with great spirit
amid applause from the audience. Then the General
put her through several motions and when drill
was over she paused before him, and asked,—</p>

<p>"Which way do you like me best, Uncle Harold—as
a boy or a girl?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>The General opened his arms and May leaped
into them. Then the hater of petticoats laid his
bearded cheek against May's soft, young face and
said,—</p>

<p>"I wouldn't exchange my little girl for all the
boys in the world!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>A GREAT GAME</small></h2>


<p>A grand stand was not an accomplished fact at
Hazelnook, but for all practical purposes the upper
rail of the fence surrounding Farmer Clarke's field
was as good a position for the enthusiasts as seats
on the bleaching boards. The spectators, therefore,
that were gathered together to witness the
game between the Plainvilles and the home team
sat on the fence like a row of birds on a telegraph
wire, and among them were Ned Payne and a large
party from Plainville. Gay was not there; he was
on the diamond in close conversation with Captain
Carver.</p>

<p>"You know about what I can do," Gay was saying,
at the very moment the game was advertised to
begin.</p>

<p>Lyman was silent; his sense of propriety was
not largely developed, and since he had known Gay
he had lost all prejudice against the presence of the
gentler sex in the field of sport, but he was not
certain that all those present would share his
views.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>"They may think it odd to see a girl play," he
said at length.</p>

<p>"No matter about that," Gay said, carelessly.
"I don't think they'll say much about it!"</p>

<p>"Play ball, can't you?" shouted the boys on the
fence.</p>

<p>"Fellows!" shouted Captain Carver, in response
to this cry, "one of our men has gone back on us.
It is not exactly his fault; his stepmother's baby
died this morning, and they won't let Will out,
although the youngster is only his half-sister, and
they are not going to bury her this afternoon, and
Will isn't really needed at home, but——"</p>

<p>Here Lyman shrugged his shoulders, as much as
to say that the ways of some people were beyond
his comprehension; then he continued, "But I've
got a substitute: Brown Walcott, of New York."</p>

<p>The Hazelnook boys cheered lustily when Lyman
ceased speaking, for Gay was now the heroine, or
hero, as the reader prefers, of the village; his treatment
of his guests at the memorable party, and his
reply to the minister, declaring himself "a radical,"
having now given him that distinction. In recognition
of this evidence of his popularity Gay stepped
forward, and with a radiant and comprehensive
smile, said:</p>

<p>"How are you, fellows?"</p>

<p>The boys expected a speech, and the hum and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>din of the field immediately ceased, but Gay did
not go on, and the Plainville faction soon recovered
its voice.</p>

<p>"No girls in mine!" shouted one of its members.</p>

<p>Then a succession of derisive remarks were shot
off like a bunch of fire-crackers, one after another:</p>

<p>"Make her a short-stop; she can't stop long!"</p>

<p>"Her petticoats will be out on a fly, if she
isn't!"</p>

<p>"Put her in the box!"</p>

<p>"She'll get in a box, fast enough!"</p>

<p>"Send her out in the field—to grass!"</p>

<p>"Don't do that; she's the same color, and it
would mix everybody up!"</p>

<p>This was more than high-spirited Gay could bear
in silence, and he shouted:</p>

<p>"When you get over your bad attack of mouth
I'll show you my real color! Unless you're color-blind
you won't call it green!"</p>

<p>This quick and truly unfeminine reply so amazed
the Plainville boys that they ceased to jeer, and Ned
Payne took the time to say:</p>

<p>"I've seen her play."</p>

<p>This quiet remark was more convincing than a
long description of Gay's good points. "I've seen
her play" hinted at remarkable achievements.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>There were a few more comments, the reverse of
complimentary or chivalrous, but they were promptly
frowned down, and cries of "Play ball!" once more
rent the air.</p>

<p>Gay was placed, and he was the first to go to
the bat.</p>

<p>The pitcher smiled, as if to say, "Fair, high, or
low ball, it will be just the same to a girl, I guess."</p>

<p>Gay saw the smile and it increased his determination
to do his best and to help win the game for the
home team.</p>

<p>"Play!" called the umpire, and the game commenced.</p>

<p>The pitcher, thinking he had nothing to fear, began
by putting the ball right on the bat. Gay astonished
him by driving it well towards the right field
and taking two bases.</p>

<p>This hit delighted Gay's admirers. "Take the
third, Brown," one of them shouted.</p>

<p>"What's the color of the grass, now?" cried
another.</p>

<p>"The color of two bases," answered a third.</p>

<p>"A two-bagger the first hit!" Ned remarked,
casting a triumphant glance at his Plainville neighbors.</p>

<p>"Don't crow too soon," one of them advised.
"One hit doesn't make an inning. When Jones
goes to the bat he'll beat her pace."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>Jones was the crack player of the Plainvilles, and
the one that the home team feared most. But this
did not seem to Ned to be any reason why he should
not say "Oh, Jones!" with a rising inflection that
made his companion's face flush.</p>

<p>Gay's successor at the bat helped him to third base
and a fumbled ball of centre's sent him over the
home base. This led to an exchange of compliments.</p>

<p>"The green grass doesn't grow under her feet,
does it?" Ned demanded with an exasperating
smile as Gay touched the plate.</p>

<p>"She can't keep it up," replied his companion
stoutly. "That's the beauty of Jones; he'd be
good for nine times nine innings."</p>

<p>At the same time Captain Carver was offering good
advice to Jones's rival. "Take it easy, Brown," he
said, quietly, "Don't let them work you up."</p>

<p>Gay sat down on the ground, drew his knees up
under his chin and watched the game intently. Lyman
threw a jacket over Gay's shoulders and stood
by his side, measuring the ability of his own and
the rival team. Gay made every error of the Plainvilles
an excuse to say something to his late deriders—I
said in the beginning that Gay was not a
model boy!</p>

<p>The home team went out in order and Jones went
to the bat amid considerable applause. It was
evident that he was away up in the opinion of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>team. He swung the bat from one hand to the other,
made a strike or two against the air, exchanged that
bat for another and whirled that around till it sung,
rejected it for a third, which seemed to suit, for he
tapped the plate smartly as much as to say, "This
bat'll do; I'm ready now to wipe out the Hazelnooks."</p>

<p>"Jonsey'll do!" was the audible comment after
this by-play with the bat.</p>

<p>"Play ball!" shouted an impatient urchin.</p>

<p>Jones smiled invitingly at the pitcher, who replied
with a swift ball. Jones put out a short fly; second
base, centre and right field went for it, the ball
dropping between them, and that sent Jones to
second base, from whence he gradually worked
home. His slow, safe playing was in direct contrast
to Gay's dash and vim and did much to advance the
latter in popular favor in which it seemed to be understood
the two players were rivals.</p>

<p>Gay's work when the Plainvilles were at bat was
good, but not such as to excite envy. When he
again took his place at the plate he hit splendidly
and came all the way on a ball that centre field
started for and misjudged badly.</p>

<p>Then a shout arose from the Hazelnook boys, to
which the Plainvilles did not enjoy listening, although
they continued by way of encouragement
to flatter their own boys and slander their opponents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>after the manner of players of greater skill. Their
spirits rose when Jones was next at bat, and hit
heavily and got third base with ease; but when he
was put out in trying to get home, their spirits
dropped again. The fact was Jones was not playing
nearly as well as the rest of the Plainville
boys, and he knew it, which was, of course, in Gay's
favor.</p>

<p>When Gay went to bat the third time he hit
fairly, but took his bases easily, stealing second,
and getting third by a walk-over, while the ball
sent up by muscular Robert was trying to kiss the
sky, and making home by a clever sprint.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Brown!" shouted Ned from the
fence, and the rest of the boys echoed his cry.
As for Captain Carver, his enthusiasm knew no
bounds.</p>

<p>"Brown," said he, in an earnest aside, "I always
thought before I knew you that girls were a pretty
slow lot, but you—you beat any boy I've seen, and
give him an hour's start, too."</p>

<p>Gay was silent. There were times when praise
made him uncomfortable. It didn't seem fair that
Lyman and the other boys should be deceived as to
the true reason for his skill and strength, but what
was he to do? Confess the truth? "Not yet!"
he always said to himself in answer to these silent
questionings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't be too sure of my doing much to-day,"
he said to Lyman. "The game is too close; a
little stupid playing will give it to them."</p>

<p>The game went on, and in the ninth inning, when
the score was twelve to eleven in the home team's
favor, the pitcher began by tossing a ball over the
plate that a baby might have hit, and Gay sent it,
for the second time, almost to the right field fence,
and took first base.</p>

<p>"Come home!" shouted the boys; "you can
do it."</p>

<p>Gay took second base with caution, and third
with a dash, and still the fielders were after the
ball.</p>

<p>"Come home!" his friends shouted. "Come,
for all you're worth!"</p>

<p>And Gay came.</p>

<p>"Look out for your skirt!" somebody shouted;
"it's slipping down."</p>

<p>Gay reached frantically for the unloosened skirt,
but it dropped below his grasp, caught him at the
knees, and tripped him while he was at full speed.
He fell heavily on his right side, and lay there
motionless.</p>

<p>"Get up!" the boys shouted. "They're sending
the ball home."</p>

<p>"Home! home!" cried centre, clapping his hands
encouragingly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>By this time Gay was on his feet, and the dress
skirt was on the ground.</p>

<p>"Here," centre cried, continuing to clap his
hands; "we'll put her out as easy as rolling off a
log!"</p>

<p>The ball came whizzing through the air; Gay
made a dash forward; centre made a bad fumble,
and Gay touched the plate, but his face was strangely
white.</p>

<p>"Play the game, boys," he said, faintly, "and
don't—tell—mother! My—arm—I——"</p>

<p>Then he fell like a log.</p>

<p>"She's got a fit!" cried the pitcher.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's worse than that," said Lyman,
a moment later. "I think her arm is broken!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>THE IDOL TOTTERS</small></h2>


<p>Gay was sent home in an improvised ambulance,
a farm wagon filled with hay. His arm was broken,
and it proved to be an ugly fracture. But when it
was set the doctor said,—</p>

<p>"You bore it bravely, Miss May—better than
most boys."</p>

<p>The doctor's praise was sweet to Gay and he
smiled faintly in reply; he was too weak to answer
with his usual animation.</p>

<p>The Hazelnooks and even the Plainville boys
and Ethel and Julia followed Gay to Rose Cottage
and were waiting on the porch for the doctor, and
when they saw him they cried in one voice,—</p>

<p>"How is she?"</p>

<p>"Weak, but she bore it like a hero, boys!" replied
the jolly doctor. "You will have to stand
on your own merits next time; May won't play
ball again this summer—the little Amazon!"</p>

<p>"We want to see her, doctor, please," said
Lyman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't please—not for two days," said the
doctor.</p>

<p>They murmured loudly against this. "Just let
us see her!" they pleaded. "Just a peep!"</p>

<p>"Not a peep!" answered the doctor, firmly.
Then the big, bluff man looked grave. "It is for
your friend's good," he added.</p>

<p>And they said no more about it, but went away
quietly and with sober faces. It was during these
two days that the Hazelnook boys and girls found
out how well they liked their friend.</p>

<p>"She's so honest and square," said Robert.</p>

<p>"And so full of fun and pluck," said Will.</p>

<p>"So bright and pretty," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Not a frill," said Ned.</p>

<p>"The jolliest girl I've ever seen," said Ethel.</p>

<p>"The finest girl living," said Fred.</p>

<p>"As deep as they make them," said Lyman.
"Who else would have said about the Radical to
the minister?"</p>

<p>Thus they spoke of the prankish boy with vast
admiration and affection, and "May's" remarks
and "May's" performances were reported by these
young people to their elders and these, also, began
to discuss "May Walcott" and to regard her
as a clever, if unconventional girl. Even the
judge's mother, who, since Gay's descent from the
coach, had prophesied gloomily that "Miss Linn's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>niece would mortify her to death" suddenly changed
her tune and declared that she had always liked the
fresh, breezy ways of the child, and that she had
known from the first that "May" was destined to
be popular.</p>

<p>"Young people nowadays," quoth the judge's
mother to the doctor's wife, "like somebody that
has some life."</p>

<p>"She certainly has made those rough village
boys quite gentlemanly," admitted the doctor's
wife.</p>

<p>These rumors and rumors of rumors reached the
ears of the Misses Linn and had much influence in
reconciling them to their supposed niece's accident
on the ball-field. They may have thought that it
would not do to criticise such a popular young
person, at all events they uttered no word of reproach,
but devoted themselves lovingly to the care
of the invalid.</p>

<p>The doctor came every day, and upon more than
one occasion he found his patient—alas for romance—decidedly
cross.</p>

<p>"Oh, Doctor, if I might just sit on the porch
and see the boys!" pleaded Gay, the second day
after the accident.</p>

<p>"Will you promise to keep quiet and not try to
do any left-handed acts?"</p>

<p>"Not an act—if you'll only let me go."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, look out for your arm!" said the doctor,
warningly, for Gay ran out of the room with a cry
of delight, without waiting for further instructions.</p>

<p>No sooner was Gay seated on the porch than
visitors sprang up as if by magic from all sides.
The truth was, Lyman was watching outside the
gate to get the first word from the doctor, and
when Gay appeared Lyman notified Will, who told
Robert, who told Ned, who in his turn imparted
the knowledge to Ethel, who informed Julia, and
at length all his friends in Hazelnook were clustered
around the invalid.</p>

<p>Then what a hubbub there was! Everybody
talked at once. Everybody laughed at once.
There was so much rejoicing that at length they
became quiet from sheer exhaustion, and the air
about was as silent as it is when a noisy machine
suddenly ceases its motion.</p>

<p>"I'm cold!" announced Gay, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Then you must go right into the house," said
Miss Celia, greatly agitated. "You can find something
in there to amuse your friends."</p>

<p>The young people went in, leaving the aunts on
the porch, and soon the sound of lively music was
heard.</p>

<p>"I hope May will be careful of her arm," said
Miss Celia, anxiously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p>"Celia, who is that coming up the drive?" said
Miss Linn, without heeding her sister's remark.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Miss Celia answered. Then,
for the first time in her life she took the initiative;
impelled by an impulse she could not have explained,
she left the porch and went to meet the
persons who were rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>The unknown visitors presented an extremely
picturesque appearance as they advanced. The
General, for of course it was he, in holiday attire,
was leading May, who wore one of the "little great-aunt's"
frocks, which looked for all the world, so
faithfully does Fashion repeat herself, as though it
had been designed by a modern artist.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the General, bowing profoundly,
"have I the honor to address Miss Celia Linn?"</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Miss Celia.</p>

<p>"I am General Haines, of Cedarville," began the
General.</p>

<p>"Don't you know Aunt Celia? I'm May,"
interrupted May.</p>

<p>"May!" repeated Miss Celia, looking closely at
the young visitor for the first time.</p>

<p>"May Walcott," May answered, with a smile,
that was strangely familiar to Miss Celia.</p>

<p>"We have one May Walcott with us now," said
Miss Celia, visibly dazed.</p>

<p>"Allow me to explain," said the General.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p>But there was no time for explanations. At that
time Gay, followed by the boys and girls agape
with curiosity, came running forward as fast as
his disabled condition would permit, and kissed May
warmly.</p>

<p>Then the twins stood side by side, and everybody
exclaimed at the resemblance.</p>

<p>"Could you tell them apart?"</p>

<p>"Except for the arm."</p>

<p>"And the dress."</p>

<p>"The same eyes!"</p>

<p>"Mouth!"</p>

<p>"Hair!"</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," said Miss Celia; "these
are certainly Elinor's twins, but how does it happen
that both are girls?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you——" Gay began.</p>

<p>"Let us go in the house," said Miss Celia, taking
the real May by the hand and giving the General,
who still held May's other hand, a smile that made
him feel that life was as fair as the dawn of spring.</p>

<p>Miss Linn met them at the hall door, but no one
thought to introduce her, and she followed them into
the drawing-room, where Gay told the story of the
masquerade with which we are already familiar.</p>

<p>"What!" they cried, when he was finished,
"are you a boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes—thank goodness!" said Gay, piously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;"><a id="i_186fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_186fp.jpg" width="405" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">GAY CAME RUNNING FORWARD</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm glad that you are a boy," said Miss Linn,
with a sigh of relief; "it explains a good many
things."</p>

<p>"My actions?" said Gay. "Oh, it was awful, I
can tell you. It is just like waiting to sneeze in
church when you know all the time you mustn't, to
try to be a girl when you are really a boy!"</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at Gay's comparison,
in which it might have been noticed the Hazelnook
young people joined very faintly. After a slight
pause Lyman arose; his companions rose, also,
for by some mysterious method of communication
they knew that they were in sympathy with what
he was about to say.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, slowly, but with suppressed
feeling, "that it was a pretty crooked thing to deceive
us deliberately by making us think that you
were a fine girl. It can't help making a difference
in our opinion of you, and I guess we'd better say
good-by."</p>

<p>Lyman bowed to the company, the others did the
same, then, like icicles under the noonday heat of
the sun, they melted away out of the room.</p>

<p>When the little maid, in the quaint old-time
frock, saw the favorite thus stripped of favor she
put her arms about his neck and whispered—</p>

<p>"You have me, no matter what happens. Don't
fuss," she added, for she had learned the lesson of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>patience. "If they really like you it will come out
all right."</p>

<p>"I don't know about it," said Gay, gloomily.
"I'm afraid I'm frozen out altogether."</p>

<p>And not until that moment did Gay realize how
highly he valued his popularity.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>THE GIRLS MAKE PEACE</small></h2>


<p>It would be difficult to decide which position was
the more enviable, the fallen idol's or that of his
erstwhile worshipers. The latter left Rose Cottage
swayed by two emotions, disappointment and indignation;
in twelve hours disappointment alone
was left; in twenty-four hours disappointment was
succeeded by a desire to talk the matter over. Not
that they were weakening, far from it, but they
wanted to look at the case squarely—and they met
at Ethel's to look at it!</p>

<p>"I think you are rather hard upon May—I mean
Gay," said Ethel. "After praising him to the skies
you suddenly turn round and drag him through the
dust. He never said he wasn't a boy; all he did
was to put on skirts, answer to his sister's name,
and act like a boy all the time. We deceived ourselves."</p>

<p>"He did it all under false colors," Lyman said
stoutly.</p>

<p>"Didn't you go into the orchard under false
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>colors?" retorted Ethel. "But when you met Gay
he overlooked that and made friends with you, and
you, at the first chance, desert him."</p>

<p>"You don't understand it, Ethel," began Ned.
"It really wasn't the thing, you know."</p>

<p>"I understand it as well as you do," replied Ned's
sister. "And you don't always do the right thing."</p>

<p>"None of us do the right thing all the time,"
said Will, "but——"</p>

<p>"There isn't any but about it," cried Ethel.
"If you won't accept a but in Gay's case you
have no right to offer one in your own."</p>

<p>"Think how he bore the pain of his broken arm,"
said Julia. "And you said yourselves that he won
the ball game for you. And you boys wouldn't
have been treated so well by us if it hadn't been
for Gay's splendid manners the day of the party."</p>

<p>The boys were somewhat affected by this argument,
but not greatly.</p>

<p>"He put up a job on us," said Lyman, stubbornly.</p>

<p>"We find it hard to forgive Gay because we
thought he couldn't do wrong," said slow Robert.
"We thought he was immense, and when we found
out that he was a little worse than most of us it was
like a crack side of the head."</p>

<p>"Did he ever do anything that wasn't splendid
except to fool you about being a girl?" Ethel
asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>"His aunts forgave him," urged Julia gently.</p>

<p>"And General Haines forgave Gay's sister, and
he had as much right to be unforgiving as you
have," Ethel said.</p>

<p>"Nobody is unforgiving," muttered Lyman.
"But I thought that he was twice as good as the
minister or anybody, and——"</p>

<p>"He always behaved like a gentleman," interrupted
Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's where the laugh comes in," Will
said.</p>

<p>"You may be as hateful as you like," announced
impetuous Ethel. "Julia and I have made up our
minds to go to Rose Cottage and try to make it up
with Gay."</p>

<p>There was some little controversy. Robert was
on the girls' side and the others soon followed his
lead. Lyman, who had been fondest of the youthful
impostor, was the last to forgive him, but in the
end he signified his willingness to accompany the
girls. They went on their way with some feeling
of shyness, which increased as they approached the
house, and deepened still further when they failed
to descry either May or Gay on the porch.</p>

<p>"Suppose he is stand-offish," said Ethel gloomily.</p>

<p>"I really can't go up there and ring the bell,"
said Will, whose courage was beginning to ooze
away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>There was no need to ring the bell; Gay and
May had seen them coming, and together they went
to meet the approaching regiment, wondering if it
came with peaceful or hostile intent.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Gay, determined to do
his share of the peacemaking.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" the group answered in one
voice.</p>

<p>Then there was an awkward pause.</p>

<p>"We have come——" began Robert, "to——"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gay, we are so sorry!" interrupted warm-hearted
Ethel.</p>

<p>"So am I, and ashamed, too," Gay replied,
soberly. "May and I talked it over last night and
we decided that although we didn't mean to we had
done a lot of deceiving. It might have been worse,
I suppose, still my sister went through a great deal,
and here is my broken arm and all on account of
our masquerading. If you can excuse me for being
a fraud I'm sure I can excuse you for being mad
about it when you found it out. I was ashamed
very often, although I tried to think it was a lark.
I am the one to ask pardon."</p>

<p>What generous words these seemed to the boys
and girls! They had never made any real mistake;
Gay was worthy of their admiration.</p>

<p>"Boy or girl; Gay or May, you're a brick,"
cried Lyman. And he voiced the sentiment of all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>"I knew if you really liked Gay it would come
out all right," May said, with a bright smile.</p>

<p>"We really like him, and you, too," Ethel said,
warmly.</p>

<p>"If you like me you must like her for we are
just the same as one," said Gay, whose good spirits
had returned.</p>

<p>Just then Aunt Celia, who surmised that a treaty
of peace had been arranged, invited them all in to
have lemonade and little Queen's cakes. She knew,
wise aunt that she was, that nothing cements a
treaty like good cheer, and that many a controversy
has been buried out of sight in a harmless merry-making.
After much laughter and lively talk the
boys and girls went away, satisfied with themselves
and with Gay. When they were alone May said,
soberly,—</p>

<p>"It hasn't been all harm. I have learned to
depend upon myself and I should not have done so
if I had had you to depend upon."</p>

<p>"I have learned never again to try to be a girl,
even in fun!" said Gay, looking ruefully at his
arm.</p>

<p>"There is one thing that troubles me, Gay; just
what mother will think of us," said May.</p>

<p>For once Gay said nothing in reply. "What
would mother think?" It was a question that he
could not answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>ALL'S RIGHT AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>The aunts, the uncle and the minister were in the
flower-perfumed drawing-room the next morning
when Mr. Walcott's letter came. The mother was
so far advanced towards health that the doctor had
ordered her away from the city.</p>

<p>"We shall collect our children and go to Lake
Hopatcong," wrote Mr. Walcott.</p>

<p>"Lake Hopatcong, indeed!" growled the General.
"Cedarville will do Edward's wife more good
than that breezy place. I shall telegraph Edward
to that effect. When do they start?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Miss Celia, to whom all the
General's questions were addressed by design.
"The children will take your message to the telegraph
office."</p>

<p>"An admirable suggestion!" gallantly responded
the General. "The longer I live the greater is my
amazement that I have ever dreamed of governing
myself without the assistance of the feminine mind."
He had forgotten Sarah's frequent "assistance!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>"My little girl taught me this," he added, thinking
that this explanation completely disguised the odor
of the implied compliment to Miss Celia.</p>

<p>"Will you not write your telegram at Celia's
davenport?" asked Miss Linn.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, madam," responded the General,
rising with unnecessary alacrity. To sit at
"Celia's davenport" was a privilege for gods—not
men!</p>

<p>While he was writing the twins came in.</p>

<p>"Listen, little girl," said the General. "I am
going to beg your father and mother, the children,
your good aunts, and Mr. Livermore here, and
Gay—the rascal! to go back with us to Cedarville;
entreat them for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you will come, won't you?" said May, by
way of entreaty.</p>

<p>Much to everybody's surprise, the minister was
the first to accept the invitation. Miss Linn declined,
but said that Celia might go. Involuntarily
the General's eyes sought those of Miss Celia,
and in them he fancied he read a desire to go
to Cedarville. For an instant—his heart beat
so—he could not speak, but finally he said, in a
low voice:</p>

<p>"You will favor me with your presence, Miss
Celia?"</p>

<p>"Thank you—for a few days—until my sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>needs me," said Miss Celia, with a faint blush that
the General thought adorable.</p>

<p>"You've forgotten something," said Gay.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?" demanded the General.</p>

<p>"You haven't invited Uncle George Walcott and
Miss Maud Berkeley. They are lovers—and you
want two of every kind in your party, like there
was in the Ark, don't you?" said Gay.</p>

<p>The General added something to his telegram to
Mr. Walcott.</p>

<p>"I have remedied that defect," he said; "have
you any further suggestions?"</p>

<p>"Invite the boys and Ethel and Julia to go with
us," said Gay; "that would be immense."</p>

<p>"You may invite them," said the General; "you
and my little girl."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Gay, heartily. "It's some
fun to have an uncle like you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the General, much pleased
with this flattery.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be a good thing to telegraph to
Sarah?" said May, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I think it would," the General said, dryly.</p>

<p>Miss Linn left the room when the twins did,
leaving the two gentlemen to feast their eyes upon
the pretty picture of domesticity made by Miss Celia
at her needlework.</p>

<p>On the way to the telegraph office May said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>"The minister likes Aunt Celia almost as well as
Uncle Harold does."</p>

<p>"The boys say he's going to marry her," said
Gay, coolly.</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold will feel dreadfully! He wants
to marry her himself," May asserted, so boldly, that
one would have said she was in the General's confidence.</p>

<p>"Then he shall have her," said Gay, with decision,
"and we'll help him along; he's an old
bachelor, and he won't know what to do."</p>

<p>"He must have read in books. You know in Jane's
novel Rudolph de Montmorenci says to Lady Arabella,
'Angel of my life, fly with me!'"</p>

<p>"That wouldn't help Uncle Harold any. Aunt
Celia can't fly, and he doesn't look as if he could!
No, May; he'll never do it by himself. We must
help him."</p>

<p>"I guess anybody as big as Uncle Harold can
manage a little woman like Aunt Celia by himself."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. Aunt Celia is little,
but she's 'kinder skittish,' for Margery says so.
But it isn't her as much as the minister we've got
to look out for. It is my opinion, May, that
he is just going to Cedarville to get ahead of Uncle
Harold. Oh, you needn't smile! A minister is
only a man, and hates to be done out of a thing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>much as anybody. But he'll be done out of Aunt
Celia—I can tell him that!"</p>

<p>"How? who will do it, Gay?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see!" was the mysterious response.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>HAPPY PEOPLE</small></h2>


<p>"Phyllis, listen to this," and Sarah unfolded
the General's telegram from Hazelnook, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Expect the family and two more by 11.30
train to-morrow morning. Prepare as for garden
party.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Harold S. Haines.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>"That's a definite telegram!" Sarah said, indignantly.
"'Expect the family!' What family?
How do I know how many there are in a family I
don't know anything about? The 'two more' are
of no consequence, but there may be three, two,
ten, six or one in that 'family.' The General certainly
needs a keeper if any man ever did."</p>

<p>"He knows you are equal to entertaining fifty
at a few hours' notice, Miss Sarah," Phyllis said,
soothingly.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that!" Sarah replied, somewhat
mollified by Phyllis' appreciative remark.
"But if nobody-knows-how-many-and-two-more are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>to be dropped down upon me at a moment's notice,
I certainly do not intend to disgrace myself. Phyllis,
we shall have to work!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Phyllis, dropping easily into the
old monosyllable.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the old mansion was in perfect
order the next morning. Flowers were everywhere,
and the August sunshine flooded the stately
rooms, for every blind and shutter was wide open.
In the great oak dining-room the table was already
spread with crystal and silver and china and damask,
the united rich possessions of many generations of
Haines' housemothers. Fruit and flowers were not
lacking, and these had been arranged by Phyllis'
deft and willing fingers. In the kitchen the banquet—a
bountiful one, you may be sure, for who
could say how many hungry mouths that mysterious
"family" might contain?—was well under way.
And Sarah—oh, Sarah was everywhere!—planning,
ordering, executing, and, of course, scolding in her
whimsical way, but in splendid humor, withal, for
she gloried in an occasion where there was encouragement
to put forth her best abilities.</p>

<p>Sarah was on the porch when the guests came, a
line of maids, with Phyllis at their head, behind
her, and her face was a study when she saw one
carriage after another drive up, and a stream of
people pour out as water flows from an inverted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>pitcher. All the General's carriages, and a roomy
buckboard, containing as many boys and girls as
could crowd in, made an impressive show. There
were Mr. and Mrs. Walcott, Miss Celia and the
minister, the General and May, Miss Maud Berkeley
and Uncle George, nurse and baby, Ned and Jane,
and Gay, Ethel, Julia, Ned Payne, Lyman, Robert,
Will, Fred, Herb, and even Philip and Rob Lawrence,
who had been picked up in the village at
May's request.</p>

<p>"Mercy me!" thought Sarah. "If all but
'two' belong in her family no wonder Mrs. Walcott
has nervous prostration! 'She,'" with a glance
at Miss Celia, "is one of the 'two.' She is prettier
than her picture and the image of his mother.
Those two young people are lovers. How alike
those twins are! No wonder they fooled everybody.
Our child is a little sweeter than the boy.
Who under the sun is that lank man with her?
Another admirer, I should say. Well, such a figure
as that can have no show beside the General, who
is a fine-looking man, barring his outlandish clothes.
Not much, Mr. Long-Legs! I'm glad I had that
second lot of ice-cream made, with all those children
there won't be a bit too much!"</p>

<p>During this soliloquy Sarah was welcoming everybody;
directing the maids as to the disposal of the
guests and looking so amiable the while that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>General was in a tremor of delight. He had not
been without misgivings as to her appreciation of
this large house party, for, as we know, he had
neglected to inform her of his invitation to the
Hazelnook boys and girls. When the last guest
was disposed of, the General followed Sarah into
the library, and looked expectantly at her.</p>

<p>"I gave her your mother's room," said Sarah,
abruptly.</p>

<p>There was no need to ask whom Sarah meant;
the General knew instinctively that it was Miss
Celia.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" he said.</p>

<p>"How did I know where to put her?" said perverse
Sarah, for she knew quite well what he meant.
"I ought to know where to put guests in this house
if anybody does."</p>

<p>"How did you know that nothing could be more
gratifying to me than to have Miss Celia Linn in
mother's room?" the General asked, earnestly.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth I didn't do it to gratify you;
I thought she belonged there; she's the image of
your mother."</p>

<p>The General actually grasped Sarah's hands.
"Have I your consent?" said he; "I mean do you
approve?"</p>

<p>"Yes,—have you hers?" replied Sarah, with a
droll smile.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>"I dare not hope, but I shall try my fate," the
General answered, soberly.</p>

<p>"I am glad if you begin to realize your duty,"
said this inconsistent woman. "You ought to have
married years ago; not waited till your wife will
have to share you with old age and rheumatism."</p>

<p>"It was never time until now," the General declared,
with youthful ardor. "Could any woman
save Miss Celia Linn fitly reign here?—I ask you
that, Sarah."</p>

<p>"You'd better ask her about reigning, not me,"
said Sarah, laughingly, and with this parting shot
she left the room.</p>

<p>In the hall she encountered the twins deep in
conversation.</p>

<p>"Miss Sarah, Gay says that you won't like him
as well as you do me!" cried May.</p>

<p>"If he's as good as you are I shall like him,"
Sarah replied.</p>

<p>"I can't be half as good as she's been lately,"
Gay said. "I would have thumped Philip into next
week if he had tried that game on me! But May
won't be as good now I am here. We need to be
together to show just what we are."</p>

<p>"Don't you think Gay might forgive Philip?"
May asked! "He says he won't."</p>

<p>"I don't mind what people do to me; but to you,
that's another thing," Gay said, stoutly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>"I like to have you speak so about me!" May
said, with a gratified smile. "But suppose the
boys and Ethel and Julia wouldn't have forgiven
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sick of so much forgiving!" cried Gay.
"It's nothing but forgive or be forgiven all the
time."</p>

<p>"To forgive and be forgiven—that is life, my
son," said a soft voice behind them. "Learn to
forgive as freely as you would be forgiven and you
will need no other lesson."</p>

<p>It was the gentle mother who spoke, pale and
fragile still, but happy to have her children around
her once more.</p>

<p>"Your little girl knows what it is to forgive,"
said Sarah, with a fond glance at May.</p>

<p>"And I know what it is to be forgiven!" said
irrepressible Gay. "That evens things up. May
and I are one, and sometimes she's the one and
sometimes I'm the one, but between us we've learned
mother's lesson of life."</p>

<p>"You see Miss Maud and Uncle George under the
trees in the garden, don't you?" Gay broke out
abruptly, a moment later. "They've been there
since we came. They don't know that they are
dusty and need dusting just as much as any of us,
because they are lovers and don't know things like
other people!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>"The garden looks cool and shady enough to
tempt any one into it," remarked the mistress, with
a longing glance through the open door.</p>

<p>Then Gay offered his arm to his mother and they
went into the garden whither everybody drifted
after awhile—even nurse, who paced up and down
the walks, not looking to the right or left, the peer
of the sixth earl of Roslyn gurgling in her arms.
Miss Celia was the last guest to appear, and she
came leaning on the General's arm. They had been
detained by a little dialogue which took place in the
library. "Hurrah!" cried Gay on their approach.
"We've got two more of Uncle George's and Miss
Maud's kind in our ark now!"</p>

<p>All eyes were immediately turned upon the pair,
and the General was moved to say something upon
this joyous occasion.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it——" he began.</p>

<p>"I can!" shouted audacious Gay. "Auntie's
awfully charitable—Aunt Beulah says she never
knew of her refusing anything to a beggar in all her
life!"</p>

<p>A shout of laughter, in which everybody but the
minister joined, greeted this remark, and the General
decided to abandon speech-making.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take care, auntie, or he'll make
you drill!" said May, who was on the other side of
the General, and held his hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>"If he should persist in making you a soldier,
Miss Celia, let me suggest that you follow your
grand-niece's example—take out the cartridge and
fill the cartridge chamber with cotton," said Mr.
Walcott, gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," said May, "I didn't think you
would tell!"</p>

<p>"If Uncle Harold values his life he will not encourage
Miss Linn in the use of fire-arms—a woman's
shot 'may turn out a song or it may turn out a
sermon'; that is, it may hit the bull's eye or it may
hit somebody behind her," said Uncle George.</p>

<p>"Miss Maud hit pretty near the bull's eye when
you were the target, and she's a woman," cried
May.</p>

<p>"May!" said the mother in a tone of gentle remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Miss Maud doesn't mind, mother, she isn't even
blushing," said Gay.</p>

<p>Miss Berkeley certainly was blushing at these unexpected
sallies, and so rosily that Sarah, thinking to
divert the attention of the younger members of the
company from her, demanded, briskly,—</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you boys and girls;
why don't you play some game? You need a little
exercise before lunch. Come, scamper!"</p>

<p>Miss Berkeley, Mr. Walcott and Uncle George
joined the children and the fun began. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>played tag, run across, and other lively games
until they were tired. While they rested Sarah
brought forth a minstrel—James, who handled a
violin as skilfully as he handled the General's
horses.</p>

<p>The banquet was the crowning glory of the day.
It began at two; it ended at twilight. Not that
they were at table all that time; there were other
interesting exercises beside that of feasting on the
delicacies housewife Sarah had provided. When
the children ceased to demand ices, the General rose
and said, with a dignified smile,—</p>

<p>"A toast!"</p>

<p>"Toast after this!" May exclaimed, with a
droll smile.</p>

<p>"You don't mean dry toast, do you, Uncle
Harold?" demanded Gay.</p>

<p>Then everybody laughed—it is astonishing how
little it takes to excite the risibilities of light-hearted
people, young or old!</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold was right," said Gay, "it is the
proper thing to toast everybody."</p>

<p>"Brown on both sides!" interrupted May.</p>

<p>"And he must be the toaster," concluded Gay.</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold, you are invited to be the 'toaster'
upon this delightful occasion," said Mr. Walcott.
"You will find the duties attendant upon the position
similar to those of the ordinary toastmaster,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>not of the cook!" The General held his glass of
lemonade high as he said,—</p>

<p>"To Miss Celia Linn! The——"</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold thinks it's cream toast!" interrupted
saucy Gay.</p>

<p>The General did not finish the toast and Miss
Celia's health was drunk amid merry laughter.</p>

<p>"To mother!" cried Gay, leaving his place at
table to run to his mother's side to kiss her before
drinking her health.</p>

<p>This put an end to formality; they toasted everybody,
Phyllis among others, for all knew her loyalty
and affection in May's hours of trial.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought that anybody like me
would have been toasted by ladies and gentlemen!"
said Phyllis, when her health was proposed.</p>

<p>"We never know what may happen to us. We
may all be roasted next!" said May, quaintly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I could hold another drop of
lemonade, not even if the president of the United
States came in and begged to be toasted!" Gay
said, despairingly.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't speeches be easier to swallow than
toasts?" asked May, with a sigh that matched Gay's
in depth and length.</p>

<p>"What, just plain, dry speeches, without anything
to make them slip down easily?" asked
Gay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," May answered.</p>

<p>"Speech! speech!" cried Mr. Walcott, who was
enjoying the fun as hugely as Lyman or Robert or
any of the boys there—and the Hazelnook boys
were enjoying themselves, albeit they had less to
say than the lively twins.</p>

<p>"Let Lyman make the first speech. He's scarcely
spoken a word," said Gay.</p>

<p>But Lyman declined the honor, saying he was
born to listen not to talk.</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" Gay demanded.</p>

<p>"Because I've one mouth and two ears," Lyman
responded promptly.</p>

<p>"And the majority rules, doesn't it, Lyman?"
said May, quickly.</p>

<p>"Say something yourself, Gay," Will urged.</p>

<p>"Yes, do," said the young people, who thought
this was their day and that the General's newly-found
happiness and the mother's improved health
were merely side issues.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gay; rise and shine," laughed May. "I
never knew before just what that meant. It means
to get up after a time like this and say something
bright, doesn't it, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the philosophy of after-dinner remarks
in a nutshell," Mr. Walcott replied.</p>

<p>"It is easy to rise!" said Gay, suiting the action
to the word, "but it's not so easy to shine. It seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>to me that after remarks ought to come before!
A fellow would feel more like it, wouldn't he, May?
(Nod from May.) You can't even get a dog to
'speak for it' worth a cent when he's had all the
bones he wants. I mean that you're really fuller
when you're empty—oh, dear! what I want to say
I can't say; and what I say I don't want to say.
But I hope everybody has had a rattling good time—(We
have! we have! from the boys in chorus.)
So have I," continued the speaker, "and I hope
we shall soon repeat this—this—some kind of an
occasion—I can't think of the word—bang-up time
will do. We couldn't have had it anywhere else in
such—such immense shape, and—somebody else
must put a P. S. on and thank Uncle Harold and
Miss Sarah. I'm tired of shining."</p>

<p>And Gay sat down amid shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>Then somebody proposed singing Auld Lang
Syne. Not that anybody specially cared to sing it,
but because Auld Lang Syne ends a good time most
appropriately, as the benediction closes service.</p>

<p>It was time for candles when they ceased singing—and
there is not much more to tell. All the
happy, tired children soon were stowed away for
the night—no one but Sarah could have arranged
such a mosaic of small cots.</p>

<p>Gay and May were not far apart, but they were
too sleepy to congratulate themselves upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>pleasant termination of their "lark." They wandered
awhile on the borders of dreamland, then the
great curtain of sleep fell upon them and upon all
the house party. We will leave them to their peaceful
repose, nor wait to greet them when the sun
shall ring up the curtain on another day.</p>
